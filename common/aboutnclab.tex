framework for a number of activities ranging from Programming, Web Design, Math, Physics and
3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) to Engineering-Level Computer Simulations in Solid Mechanics,
Fluid Dynamics, Electromagnetics, Neutronics and other fields. NCLab serves students, 
instructors, researchers, engineers, and the general public all over the world. It can be 
used free of charge for personal non-commercial purposes such as private hobby or self-education, 
as well as for individual non-funded academic research.

\noindent
\subsection*{Why is NCLab Not Free for Institutions?}
NCLab is very different from standard commercial products since it {\em provides resources for 
its users}. These resources include cloud storage, memory, CPU time and even web hosting.
Therefore, institutions who are the heaviest resource consumers need to {\bf purchase a license} 
prior to using NCLab in classroom, for research, or for commercial projects (see Terms of Use and 
Pricing). These fees are extremely small compared to traditional commercial products. 

\subsection*{Terms of Use and Pricing}
More details on purchasing a license and using NCLab are provided in the online documents 
{\bf Pricing} and {\bf Terms of Use} that are accessible from NCLab's home page 
{\tt http://nclab.com}.
