\section{Plotting}

\subsection{}

These arrays will contain the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the vertices of a polygon 
with $n$ equally-long edges, that is inscribed into a circle of 
center $[0, 0]$ and radius $R > 0$. Here {\tt n > 2} is an integer number 
and {\tt R > 0} is a real number. The polygon should be oriented counter clock-wise

correspond to a linear subdivision of the parameterization interval 
$[0, 1]$ with {\tt n} points. Use the function {\tt planarcurve} to
plot the curve corresponding to the functions {\tt f(t)} and {\tt g(t)} 
defined above. Axes should be scaled equally.

Imagine that you stand on a very high bridge $H$ meters above 
the river and throw a stone with velocity $v$ in horizontal direction. 
The coordinates of the flying stone as functions of time $t$ are
$x(t) = t v$ and $y(t) = H - 0.5gt^2$ where $g = 9.81$ kgms$^{-2}$ is
the gravitational acceleration. Use these formulas to write a function 
{\tt stone(t, H, v)} that for any time {\tt t} returns the $x$ and 
$y$ coordinates of the flying stone. Then calculate and plot the trajectory 
of the stone since the moment it leaves your hand until it falls into the 
river! Hint: Proceed by choosing a small time step {\tt dt} such

The way Archimedes first estimated the value of $\pi$ was 
by taking a circle and calculating the perimeters of inscribed and 
circumscribed equilateral polygons with many edges. Let's do the same 
with the help of a computer! Proceed as follows: Choose some radius 
$R > 0$. Write a function {\tt in(R, n)} that will calculate the perimeter 
of an equilateral polygon with $n$ edges that is inscribed into the
circle of radius $R$. Then write a function {\tt out(R, n)}
that calculates the perimeter of a circumscribed equilateral polygon 
with $n$ edges. Choose a tolerance {\tt tol} such as {\tt 1e-3} and 
begin with $n = 3$. For each $n$ calculate the values {\tt in(R, n)}
and {\tt out(R, n)}. While the difference between these areas is 
greater than {\tt tol}, keep increasing $n$ by one. After the while 
loop finishes, take the final perimeters, divide them by $2 R$, and 
you just calculated a lower and upper estimate of $\pi$!

\subsection{}

Write a Python function {\tt select(T, n)} that for any tuple {\tt T}
      returns its item with index {\tt n}. Indices start from zero as usual.
      If index is out of range, print "Index out of range, returning zero." and 
      return zero.

\subsection{}

Write a Python function {\tt supersort(LL)} that takes a list of lists {\tt LL}, 
      rearranges the order of lists in {\tt LL} according to their length increasingly,
      and returns the sorted list of lists.

\subsection{}

Write a Python function {\tt sortdict(D, n)} where {\tt D} is a dictionary whose values 
      are lists. For an index {\tt n}, your function should return the list of keys sorted 
      according to the values with index {\tt n}, in increasing order.

\section{Counting Loop} 

\subsection{}

Write a Python function {\tt primes(n)} that for a positive number {\tt n} returns the list 
      of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to {\tt n}. The list 
      should be sorted increasingly. Remember that the smallest prime number is 2.

\subsection{}

Write a Python function {\tt charstats(L)} that takes a list of 
      text strings {\tt L}, and creates a statistics of characters present in {\tt L}. 
      The text strings in {\tt L} can contain alphabetic, numeric, and special characters. 
      Your function should return a dictionary whose keys are the different characters. 
      For each character in the dictionary, the value is the number of its appearances 
      in {\tt L}.

\subsection{}

The Rubik's cube shown in Fig. \ref{fig:rubik} is a famous brain teaser. Initially,
      each face has nine fields of the same color, and there are six different colors on the 
      cube (one per each face).
      The cube has three layers in each axial direction that can rotate about the axis.
      Your task is to implement a Python function {\tt rubik()} that calculates the total 
      number of all possible states of the cube
      accounting for different rotations (in other words, rotating the entire 
      cube by 90 degrees in any of the three axial directions yields a different state).

\subsection{}

Write a Python function {\tt maximize(L1, L2)} that takes two lists of real numbers and 
finds a number {\tt n1} in {\tt L1} and a number {\tt n2} in {\tt L2} such that the product 
{\tt n1 * n2} is maximal. Return the numbers {\tt n1} and {\tt n2}.

\section{Exceptions}

\subsection{}

Implement a custom plotting function {\tt sureplot(f, a, b, label, n = 100)} where {\tt f(x)} is 
      a user-supplied real function, {\tt (a, b)} is an interval, {\tt label} 
      is a text string label for the plot, and {\tt n} is the plotting subdivision of the interval {\tt (a, b)}.
      Implement exception handling in such a way that if the user's function is not defined for some {\tt x}, 
      a warning is printed and the corresponding point is not added to the plot. But the rest of the graph
      will be plotted normally. For example, if the use wants to plot the function 
\begin{verbatim}
def f(x):
    return log(x)
\end{verbatim}
in the interval {\tt (-1, 1)} then the left half of the graph will be missing but the rest 
will be displayed correctly.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

Coming soon.

\subsection{}

Implement a Boolean function {\tt dryrun(f)} which will run any user-supplied function {\tt f()}.
      If the function {\tt f()} contains a syntax error, print a warning and return {\tt False}. If the 
      call to the user's function was successful, return {\tt True}.

\section{Object-Oriented Programming}

\subsection{}

Implement a Python-dictionary-based smart translator class {\tt wordmagic} that 
      will have the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item Constructor with no parameters.
\item {\tt add(expr1, expr2)}: Boolean method that adds a pair of text strings into 
      the dictionary. The former is the key, the latter the corresponding value. 
      If {\tt expr1} or {\tt expr2} are already present in the dictionary,
      let the user know, do not add them, and return {\tt False}. Otherwise return {\tt True}.
\item {\tt translate(expr)}: Boolean method that searches all keys as well as all values,
      and translates the expression {\tt expr} automatically either way. If the expression 
      was found, return {\tt True}, otherwise let the user know and return {\tt False}.
\item {\tt flush()}: Method that prints all pairs contained in the dictionary (first key, then value).
      Keys need to be sorted alphabetically.
\item {\tt flush\_reverse()}: Method that prints all pairs contained in the dictionary, in
      reverse order (first value, then key). Values need to be sorted alphabetically.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Solution}

Coming soon.

\subsection{}\label{numbermagic}

Implement a Python class {\tt numbermagic} whose data is just one integer number, and 
whose methods are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Constructor that takes one integer number as a parameter and stores it in the object. 
      If the user supplies a non-integer number, print a warning and round it to an integer. 
\item {\tt insert(new\_num)}: Method that replaces the number stored in the object with {\tt new\_num}.
\item {\tt ispositive()}: Boolean method that returns {\tt True} if the number stored in the object is 
      greater than zero, {\tt False} otherwise.
\item {\tt iseven()}: Boolean method that returns {\tt True} if the number stored in the object is even,
      {\tt False} otherwise.
\item {\tt isprime()}: Boolean method that returns {\tt True} if the number stored in the object is a prime,
      {\tt False} otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Solution}

Coming soon.

\subsection{} \label{vectormagic}

Implement a Python class {\tt vectormagic} whose data are two three-dimensional vectors.
All vectors are represented by lists of length three. The class has the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item Constructor that takes two vectors as parameters and stores them in the object. 
      If the length of any of the two lists is different from three, let the user know and 
      complete it with zeros, or truncate it to length three. 
\item {\tt areparallel()}: Boolean method that returns {\tt True} if the vectors are parallel,
      {\tt False} otherwise. Note: If you are going to compare a real number against zero,
      use a small tolerance, such as {\tt 1e-8}.
\item {\tt arenormal()}: Boolean method that returns {\tt True} if the vectors are perpendicular,
      {\tt False} otherwise. Again: If you are going to compare a real number against zero,
      use a small tolerance, such as {\tt 1e-8}.
\item {\tt innerproduct()}: Returns one real number which is the inner product of the two vectors.
\item {\tt vectorproduct()}: Returns a vector (list of length three) which is the vector product 
      of the two vectors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{} \label{plottingmagic}

Implement a Python class {\tt plottingmagic} whose data is a Python list or dictionary -- your choice. 
      This list or dictionary will serve as a simple database of two-dimensional geometrical objects that 
      the user adds to the plot. All objects will have names (text string identifiers) but also numerical 
      indices reflecting the order in which they were added. The user will be able to display just one 
      selected object, or multiple objects simultaneously, referencing them either by their names or by 
      their indices. Let's make this description more accurate. The class has the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item Constructor with no parameters.
\item {\tt addline(a, b, name)}: Method that adds a straight line connecting points {\tt a}
      and {\tt b}. 
\item {\tt addpolyline(pts\_list, name)}: Method that adds a piecewise-straight polyline 
      formed by points in the {\tt pts\_list}. 
\item {\tt addcircle(r, c, name)}: Method that adds circle of radius {\tt r} and center point {\tt c}.
\item {\tt getindex(name)}: Method that returns the index of the object whose text string identifier is {\tt name}.
\item {\tt getname(i)}: Method that returns the name of the object whose index identifier is {\tt i}.
\item {\tt delete(name)}: Method that deletes object referenced by its name. All indices need to be 
      recalculated to start with zero and form a continuous sequence of integers. 
\item {\tt delete(i)}: Method that deletes object referenced by its index {\tt i}. Again, all indices need to be 
      recalculated.
\item {\tt plot\_by\_name(L)}: Method that plots all objects whose names are in the list {\tt L}. Display names in the plot.
\item {\tt plot\_by\_index(L)}: Method that plots all objects whose indices are in the list {\tt L}. Display names in the plot.
\end{itemize}

\section{Class Inheritance}

\subsection{}

Create a descendant {\tt numberhero} of the class {\tt numbermagic} from Exercise \ref{numbermagic}
      that in addition to the functionality contained in the class {\tt numbermagic} has one new
      method:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt factorize()}: Method that returns a Python list containing primes {\tt p1, p2, ..., pn}
      that form the prime number factorization of the number stored in the object. We recommend 
      that you write a recursive algorithm for the prime number factorization. This is a very 
      nice exercise for recursion.

\subsection{}

Create a descendant {\tt vectorhero} of the class {\tt vectormagic} from Exercise \ref{vectormagic}
      that in addition to the functionality contained in the class {\tt vectormagic} has one new

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt project(V)}: If the two vectors contained in the object form a plane, the 
      method calculates and returns the projection of the vector {\tt V} into this plane. 
      Otherwise the method prints a warning and returns a zero vector.

\item {\tt addbezier2(P1, P2, P3, num)}: Method that adds to the database a quadratic B\'ezier curve based 
      on the three control points {\tt P1, P2, P3}. The parameter {\tt num} is a plotting subdivision. 
      See the note below on how B\'ezier curves are defined.
\item {\tt addbezier3(P1, P2, P3, P4, num)}: Method that adds to the database a cubic B\'ezier curve based 
      on the four control points {\tt P1, P2, P3, P4}.
