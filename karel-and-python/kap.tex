\section*{Foreword}
This course provides a gentle yet efficient and comprehensive introduction to modern algorithmic 
design and computer programming. It covers two programming languages -- {\em Karel the Robot} 
and {\em Python}. These two languages were chosen on purpose. The former has a playful 
appearance but it develops advanced algorithmic skills quickly. 
The latter is a modern high-level dynamical programming language that is widely 
used in business, science, and engineering applications today. Python is also well known
for its intuitive nature, simple syntax, and powerful libraries. 

Starting with Karel the Robot, students discover principles of computer programming effortlessly,
without being exposed to technical details of conventional programming languages.
Could such an introduction be done with a conventional programming language? Yes, but 
it would be obscurred and slowed down by technicalities, not mentioning that it would 
not be fun. The course starts out in Manual mode (Level 0) where the robot can be guided via 
clicking on five buttons {\em Go} (make one step forward), {\em Left} (turn left), {\em Right} 
(turn right), {\em Put} (put a gem on the groud) and {\em Get} (pick up a gem from the ground).

\label{fig:f1}

\end{figure}
\noindent
In the next stage which is called {\em Bridge to Programming} students keep solving problems,
but they type the commands 
{\tt go}, {\tt left}, {\tt right}, {\tt put} and {\tt get} instead of clicking on the 
corresponding buttons. This breaks the ice!

The need for higher functionality such as loops, conditions, and custom commands arises 
naturally. Students also learn to understand why it is a good idea to decompose complex 
tasks into smaller ones that are easier to solve. This is the most important principle of computer 
programming. As this textbook is written by programming experts, students also learn a lot 
about good and bad programming habits, a know-how that is scarcely presented in textbooks 
at this stage.

\noindent
The syntax of Karel the Robot is very close to Python -- in fact Python feels like Karel's
older brother. The transition from Karel to Python is as seamless as the transition from 
one Karel's Level to another. 
In Python, students continue building their skills in the same way as they did with Karel. Of 
course they learn more advanced concepts including mathematical operations, plotting, local and 
global variables, strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, and others. And they also get to solve 
more realistic problems. But Python is still a lot of fun. 

A very strong aspect of Python programming are its libraries. There is the Standard Library which 
contains many build-in functions that are not present in lower-level languages such as 
Java, C, C++ or Fortran. Python also has very powerful scientific libraries including 
Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pylab, Sympy and others. With these, students can start solving 
real scientific and engineering problems. These libraries are covered at the end of this 
course.  




%Taking this course will make it much easier 
%for you to learn Python, C, C++ and other advanced programming languages. In particular we 
%recommend that after Karel you continue with Python, a powerful programming 
%language that is used across all science and engineering areas, and yet it is 
%technically simpler to handle than C or C++.

\section{What next?}

Congratulations on making it to the end of the tutorial! We hope that you
enjoyed it. If you can think of any ways to improve the application 
Karel the Robot or this tutorial, please let us know. If you 
have an interesting game for Karel, please let us know as well. 

Although you may feel like an Almighty Programmer right now, we would
recommend staying humble. Even the most experienced programmers are
learning new things all the time. If you enjoy programming, your next 
language to learn may be Javascript since this 
is the most popular language for web development. Depending on your 
other hobbies or interests, Java, C++ or even Fortran might be interesting. 
In any case, our team wishes you good luck, and keep us in your 
favorite bookmarks! \\
