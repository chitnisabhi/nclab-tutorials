\subsection*{NCLab's Karel vs. the Original Version}
This publication features {\em Karel the Robot}, a programming language 
designed by Richard E. Pattis. Compared to its original version that was
strongly influenced by Pascal, the NCLab version is closer to Python.
There are some other differences as well that make Karel in NCLab easier to use 
for kids -- Karel collects gems instead of beepers, he has a home in the 
maze, and he uses commands that are much easier for kids to understand
and type. For example, {\tt pickbeeper} was replaced with {\tt get}, 
{\tt front-is-clear} was replaced with {\tt wall}, etc. Python 
colons following every command are omitted because using the SHIFT key 
was causing difficulties to some 5 years old programmers. 
Otherwise we have not changed Pattis' original ideas and all functionality 
covered in Pattis' book is available in the Basic Version free of charge.

\section{Introduction}

This course will teach you principles of modern algorithmic design and  
computer programming with the help of an interactive graphical application 
{\em Karel the Robot} in NCLab. Taking this course will make it much easier 
for you to learn Python, C++ and other advanced programming languages. In particular we 
recommend that after Karel you continue with Python, a powerful programming 
language that is used across all science and engineering areas. The textbook
{\em Python Programming for Beginners} is available in PDF via the link 
"Tutorials and Videos" on NCLab home page.

\subsection{Brief history}

Karel the Robot is a famous educational programming language that was introduced by Richard E. 
Pattis in his book "Karel The Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Programming" in 1981. 
Pattis first used the language in his courses at Stanford University, and now it is used at 
countless schools in the world to introduce students to algorithmic design and computer programming. 
The language is named after Karel \v{C}apek, a Czech writer who invented the word "robot" in his 1921 
science fiction play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).

\subsection{Who is Karel?}

Karel is a little robot that lives in a maze, and the maze contains gems that he loves to collect!
He was created with only five simple commands in his memory:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{green} \tt go} ... make one step forward.
\item {\color{green} \tt get} ... pick up a gem from the ground. 
\item {\color{green} \tt left} ... turn to the left.
\item {\color{green} \tt right} ... turn to the right. 
\item {\color{green} \tt put} ... put a gem on the ground. 
\end{itemize}
He also has five built-in sensors that allow him to check his immediate surroundings:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{green} \tt wall} ... true if he would crash into a wall by making one more step, false otherwise. 
\item {\color{green} \tt gem} ... true if he stands on a gem, false otherwise.
\item {\color{green} \tt north} ... true if he is facing North, false otherwise.
\item {\color{green} \tt home} ... true if he is at home, false otherwise.
\item {\color{green} \tt empty} ... true if his bag with gems is empty, false otherwise. 
\end{itemize}
During this course you will help Karel solve many exciting tasks starting with very simple ones and 
gradually progressing to more challenging. In this way Karel becomes a great robot, and you 
will become a great programmer!

\subsection{Tell me {\em one reason} why I should take this course}

Computer programming skills are highly valued nowadays, and they will be even more 
valued in the future. In this course you will learn to design great algorithms -- an ability that 
is completely language-independent. In other 
words, you can learn the same with a technically complicated conventional 
programming language, battling technical problems most of the time,
or you can learn it with Karel the easy way.
Despite its playful appearance, Karel is {\em not a toy language}. It contains all elements 
of modern procedural programming. The complexity of algorithms 
that you will encounter in this course ranges from {\em extremely simple} 
to {\em extremely tough}.

\subsection{How does Karel differ from conventional programming languages?}

The biggest difference between Karel and conventional procedural
programming languages is that it {\em does not contain any mathematics}.
Believe it or not -- Karel does not know numbers! In this course, you 
will solve many exercises whose objective is to teach you how to 
design great algorithms, and math is not needed for that. 
Thanks to the beautiful simplicity of Karel's language, the resulting 
computer codes are crystal clear.
 
After finishing this tutorial, you will be able to transition instantly to
Python, a powerful modern programming language. And then, you will be only 
learning language-specific details, because the most important skill in computer programming -- designing great algorithms -- you will already have.
 
\section{Explore NCLab}

Before beginning this course, we invite you to create an account in 
NCLab, log in, and take a while to explore the many activities 
that NCLab offers. A great companion reading is {\em Intro to NCLab - Part I 
(Meet the Cloud)} that is available in PDF via the link "Tutorials and Videos"
on NCLab home page {\tt http://nclab.com}.\\

\section{Meet Karel}

Karel can be launched in several different ways. The simplest one is to click on the icon 
"Programming" and select "Karel" in the menu. This will launch the application 
and load a randomly selected maze, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:init}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/init.png}
\end{center}
%\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Launching Karel via the Programming icon.}
\label{fig:init}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Karel will be launched in {\em Programming mode} which is the most-frequently 
used one. You can easily switch to the {\em Manual mode}, {\em Builder},
and {\em Game mode} in the menu. Game mode is available in Full Version only. 
These modes will be discussed in more detail later.

\subsection{Cloning Karel projects} \label{cloning}

All programs and exercises that we will work with are
available for you to clone. To do this, 
click on the File Manager icon. In the File Manager's menu go to 
"Project" and then click on "Clone". This will launch a new window 
with Displayed Projects as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cloning}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/cloning.png}
\end{center}
%\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{File Manager's "Project" menu allows you to clone many Karel projects.}
\label{fig:cloning}
\end{figure}
\noindent
All projects whose names start with "Karel - Exercise" are of particular interest 
for this tutorial. Their solutions have names starting with "Karel - Solution". 
Any of them can be cloned into your account via clicking on the project name in the window, 
and pressing the button "Clone".

In the File Manager's right-hand side panel, you will see the list of all 
projects that you cloned. Click on any of them to launch it. You are free to 
use the cloned projects as they are, or modify them in any way you like. Your 
modifications will not affect the original. And, you can 
always synchronize your version with the original, via 
a right-click on the project in the File Manager and selecting "Synchronize".
Beware though -- synchronizing with the original will erase any changes that 
you made to the project.

\subsection{Basic and Full Versions}

If you are using NCLab in Basic Version, some restrictions apply (this does not concern
institution-sponsored users): The number of saved files is limited, private projects are 
not enabled. and Game mode in Karel is not enabled. Basic Version can be upgraded to Full
via the "Upgrade" icon on desktop.

\subsection{Karel modes}

Karel operates in four modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Manual mode:} The robot is controlled using the mouse and five buttons Go, Get, Left, Right, and Put. 
      Watch out and do not crash!
\item {\em Program mode:} The robot is controlled using written programs (computer code). The Program mode is 
      split into several Levels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Level 1 is a transition layer between the Manual and Programming modes. Programs are written using only 
      five commands {\tt go}, {\tt get}, {\tt left}, {\tt right}, and {\tt put} that exactly correspond to 
      the buttons Go, Get, Left, Right, and Put in Manual mode.
\item Level 2 is where the actual programming begins. On top of the commands from Level 1, programs can contain 
      conditions, loops, and custom commands.
\item Level 3 teaches the user to operate with logical and numerical variables, and with computer memory. Karel  
      also has receives a GPS device. This Level is in preparation.
\item Level 4 teaches the basics of object-oriented programming. This Level is in preparation.
\item Level 5 teaches the basics of parallel programming. This Level is in preparation.
\end{itemize}
\item {\em Build mode:} This mode allows the user to create custom mazes.
\item {\em Game mode:} Makes it possible to create and play games. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Section B - Bridge to Programming}

In this Section we will learn to use written commands {\tt go}, {\tt get}, {\tt left}, {\tt right}, and {\tt put} 
instead of pressing the buttons Go, Get, Left, Right, and Put. The written commands do exactly the same as the 
buttons. 

\subsection{Entering and running programs}

There are a couple of simple new rules to remember:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Programs are entered into input cells on the left (one will appear after you press Start).
\item Always type one command per line -- this does not hold only for Karel but for 
      programming in general. It makes computer code much easier to read.
\item There should not be empty spaces in front of commands.
\item Clicking on "clear" under an input cell will erase its contents.
\item You can add a new input cell by clicking on "add" (located under each input cell). 
      Having multiple input cells can be useful, for example, to test various versions 
      of your program, or if you want to run parts of your program separately. 
\item Clicking on "remove" under an input cell will remove it. All text in that cell will be lost.
\item Run programs via the blue arrow button in the menu (this will run all 
      cells). Each cell can be run separately by clicking on "run" (located under 
      each input cell). 
\end{enumerate}
You can clone all exercises in this Section into your account via the File Manager's Project
menu, same as you did with the ones in Section A.

\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Name the five written commands that you can use to guide Karel.
\item Where do we enter programs for Karel?
\item Should we enter empty spaces in front of commands?
\item How many commands per line should we type?
\item How can we add a new input cell?
\item When can having multiple input cells be useful?
\item How can we erase all text from an input cell?
\item How can we remove an input cell?
\item How can we evaluate all input cells at once?
\item How can we evaluate just one selected input cell?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise B01 - Go Command}

{\em Write a program that gets Karel home! Remember: Typing "go" is exactly 
the same as pressing the Go button. Always write one command per line.}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure}
\noindent


\section{Section C - Counting Loop}

In the last Section we successfully crossed the bridge between Clicking  
and Programming. The bridge collapsed, there is no way back. But do not worry
about that, the land of Programming is much more beautiful!

\subsection{Programming wisdom}

In Section B we learned that Karel accepts written commands as an alternative to 
manual control. He always obeys the commands {\em exactly}. It may happen that 
you plan one thing, tell it to the robot, but the robot does something different.
In that case you need to go back, look at your program, and see where the 
mistake is. Mistakes in programs are called {\em bugs} and the procedure of eliminating them 
is called {\em debugging}. Depending on how careful you 
were while preparing and writing your program, and how complex the program is,
this may take quite a bit of time. It really helps to be careful and 
think twice before writing a program. You have to go in your mind through 
all the commands that you want the robot to follow. You have to play the program 
in your head, then the robot will do exactly what you want him to do. 

\subsection{The {\tt repeat} command}

The counting loop, represented by the {\tt repeat} command, can save 
you lots of writing when something is repeated. For example, for 
Karel to make seven steps forward we could type:

\begin{verbatim}
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
\end{verbatim}
But this is neither efficient nor elegant. Instead, the same can be
achieved by telling Karel to {\tt repeat} the {\tt go} command {\tt 7} times:

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 7
  go
\end{verbatim}
There are a few simple rules that we need to remember when using the {\tt repeat} command:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write clean code -- always write one command per line.
\item Indentation -- all commands to be repeated (the {\em body of the loop}) need to be indented. You can
      choose whether you prefer 2-indents or 4-indents. The former yields more compact 
      code with not-so-long lines, the latter is easier to read. 
\item Cancel the indentation for the first command that does not belong to the body of the loop.
\end{itemize}
To illustrate what the indentation does, let's look at a code that will move the robot 8 steps forward:

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 4
  go
  go
\end{verbatim}
Compare to a code that will only move the robot 5 steps forward:

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 4
  go
go
\end{verbatim}
Multiple {\tt repeat} commands can be {\em nested}. This means that a {\tt repeat} command 
can used in the body of another {\tt repeat} command. Everything that was said about indentation 
still holds. Can you figure out what the following code does?

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 10
  repeat 5
    go
  repeat 2
    left
\end{verbatim}
After you figure it out, launch Karel via the Programming menu, enter this code into
the input cell, and run it! But before you do, remember to switch to Builder and make some free space around the robot 
so that he does not crash into a wall.

\subsection{Review questions} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is a {\em bug} in a computer code?
\item What do we mean by {\em debugging}?
\item What is {\em body of loop} and why is it indented?
\item What are the two possible indents that we can use?
\item Write a program for Karel to rotate 360 degrees.
\item Write a program for Karel to pick up 5 gems from the ground, walk 10 steps forward, put the 5 gems 
      on the ground again, turn back, and return to its original position. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise C01 - Sprint}

{\em Karel's home is ten steps away, so you could type "go" ten times to get him home. However, using the "repeat" command you can do this with only {\bf two lines}! Remember to use an indent of 2 or 4 empty characters on the new line after the {\tt repeat} command.}

{\em Karel is about to find a pile of 12 gems! Write a program for the robot to collect the gems and get home. Use the {\tt repeat} command for any repeated action. Remember to use an indent of 2 or 4 empty characters on the new line after each {\tt repeat} command. You have to cancel the indentation when the next command to come does no longer belong to the body of the {\tt repeat} command. }

\end{figure}

\section{Section D - Conditions}

Karel has built-in sensors to better navigate in the maze:

\subsection{Karel's five sensors}

The first one is an infrared sensor that the robot uses to determine 
whether it is safe to make one step forward, or whether there is a wall.
The usage can be illustrated using a simple program "Careful step" 
where Karel first checks whether there is a wall ahead before
making a step. If there is wall, he turns back: 

\begin{verbatim}
# Program "Careful step".
if wall
  repeat 2
    left
else
  go
\end{verbatim}
Note that the symbol {\tt \#} introduces a comment, meaning that the line 
of code behind it is ignored by the robot.
The {\tt else} branch does not have to be there if it is not needed. Notice the indentation 
of the bodies of the {\tt if} and {\tt else} branches - this is analogous 
to how we indent the body of the {\tt repeat} command.

Besides {\tt wall}, the robot can check the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt gem} ... is there a gem where he stands?
\item {\tt empty} ... is his bag with gems empty?
\item {\tt north} ... is he facing North?
\item {\tt home} ... is he at home?
\end{itemize}
Karel can also use the reserved word {\tt not} to test the opposites.
For illustration, the previous program can be rewritten as follows, without changing its function:
\begin{verbatim}
# Program "Careful step".
if not wall
  go
else
  repeat 2
    left
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Errors}

If you crash the robot into a wall, if you ask him to collect a gem where there
is none, or if you ask him to put a gem on the ground while 
his bag is empty, {\bf he will throw an error}. This means that 
he will write an errro message and stop executing the program. 

\subsection{Programming wisdom}

Good programmer is a careful programmer! Errors can be avoided by always checking the 
appropriate sensor before making an action. A few examples of careful actions:
 
\begin{verbatim}
if not wall
  go
\end{verbatim}
Another example:
 
\begin{verbatim}
if gem
  get
\end{verbatim}
And a last one:
 
\begin{verbatim}
if not empty
  put
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the five sensors that Karel can use, and what do they do?
\item Can he  see from where he stands whether a wall is two steps ahead?
\item Can he check without turning whether a wall is on his right?
\item Can he check from where he stands whether a gem is one step away?
\item Can he check from where he stands whether his home is one step away?
\item Can he check whether he has at least one gem in the bag?
\item Can he check without turning whether he faces West?
\item Write a program for Karel to check whether Karel stands on a gem, and if so, to pick it up.
\item Write a program for Karel to check whether his bag is not empty, and if not, to put one gem on the ground. 
\item Write a program for Karel to turn North. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise D01 - In the Fog}

{\em Several gems lie on the ground between the robot and his home which is 10 steps away. 
He cannot see where they are exactly since his sensor only tells him if a gem is right 
under him.  And besides that, nothing is visible in today's foggy weather anyway. 
Write a program for Karel to collect all gems and get home. With one command per 
line, your program should have at most 4 lines.}

\subsection{Exercise D02 - Stony Meadows}

{\em Karel is walking on a meadows that is covered with irregularly 
scattered stones. Write a program for the robot to get to his home,

{\em Karel stores all his gems in a secret chest in his cellar. 
Currently, some shelves are empty. Write a program for Karel to 
inspect all shelves and put a gem where one is missing! After that, he needs to get 
home as usual. With one 
command per line, your program should have at most 7 lines.}

\end{figure}
\noindent



\section{Section E - Conditional Loop}

In this section we will learn another type of loop that is highly useful 
in programming.

\subsection{The {\tt while} command}

Often Karel needs to repeat something, {\em not knowing in advance how many repetitions
there will be}. This can be the case, for example, 
when he is asked to walk straight ahead until he reaches the closest wall.
Remember that he only can see walls that are right ahead of him; walls 
that are further away he can't see. Such a program would be:

\begin{verbatim}
while not wall
  go
\end{verbatim}
Or, he may be asked to walk until he gets home:

\begin{verbatim}
while not home
  go
\end{verbatim}
Or, he may be asked to empty his bag (he does not know how many gems are in it): 
 
\begin{verbatim}
while not empty
  put
\end{verbatim}
Or, he may be asked to collect all gems from a pile (he does not know 
how many gems there are):

\begin{verbatim}
while gem
  get
\end{verbatim}
Or we may ask him to turn to face North (he does not know which direction he is
facing):

\begin{verbatim}
while not north
  left
\end{verbatim}
At last, Karel is asked to 
turn South, walk straight ahead until he reaches the closest wall, and 
collect all gems that he can find on the way:

\begin{verbatim}
# First turn North.
while not north
  left

# Then turn South.
repeat 2
  left

# Go straight ahead and pick all gems.
while not wall
  if gem
    get
  go

# Pick gem at the wall (if any).
if gem
  get
\end{verbatim}
Notice that we first need to turn the robot to face North -- this is because North 
is the only direction that he can check!

\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the difference between the {\tt repeat} and {\tt while} loops?
\item Write a program for Karel to turn North {\em not using} the {\tt while} loop. 
\item Then write a program for Karel to turn North {\em using} the {\tt while} loop. 
      Compare the length and elegance of this program with the one from the 
      previous question.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise E01 - South West}

{\em Karel is lost and he does not even know whether he is facing north, south, east or west! He only knows that his home is in the south-west corner of the maze. Write a program for the robot to get there. Hint: First you need to orient the robot to face north, that's the only direction that he can check with his sensors.}

\subsection{Exercise E02 - Hide-and-Seek}

{\em Karel's friends are hiding. He knows that he has to go straight 
ahead to find them. When he finds a gem, he has to turn left and keep 
walking. Eventually, he will get to the place where his friends are 
hiding. If he gets home, stop. Write a program for Karel to do this, 
and do not forget to collect all the gems on the way!}

\section{Section F - Defining New Commands}

\subsection{Programming wisdom}

{\em Always look for small tasks that can be solved independently of the big ones.
Solve the small tasks first, and you'll see that the big ones get much simpler. The 
importance of what we just said cannot be stressed more. Please read these three 
lines once more.}\\

\noindent
The fact that you are reading this line of text proves that you are not 
a perfect programmer yet. Otherwise you would be stuck forever in the 
previous infinite loop!

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/smiley.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}


\subsection{More programming wisdom}

A new command should be defined whenever it becomes clear that the same 
action is repeated in the algorithm multiple times (yes, we talk about the algorithm,
not about the program). If you start writing a program and then realize that the same
code repeats itself at various places, then probably you did not do a good job 
designing the algorithm.

Sometimes it might be 
tempting to just copy and paste the same code several times in the 
program, because it does the same thing, but never do it! This would be very bad programming
and sooner or later your own code would punish you for that. 
You would make a small change at one place but forget to do it 
in all the other places. Then your code would start 
acting strange, it would sometimes work and sometimes fail. 
You would spend lots of time looking for the mistakes, find some 
of them but not all, and your program would become unreliable
and after some time irreparable. You would find that you need to 
rewrite it from scratch.

\subsection{Defining new commands}

New commands are defined using the reserved word 
{\tt def}. For example, in a program where the robot needs to turn back
many times, it is a good idea to define a new command {\tt back}
as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
def back
  repeat 2
    left
\end{verbatim}
Note the indent -- the body of a new command needs to be indented 
analogously to the bodies of loops and conditions.

\subsection{Revisiting exercise A07}

Let us return to the exercise A07 - Right Button for a moment.
A really bad program to solve this task would be:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
right
go
go
go
go 
get
right
go
go
go
go 
get
right
go
go
go
go
get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Can you see how many times the same code is repeated?! In order to fix this, 
we should define new command {\tt foursteps} as
follows:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def foursteps
  repeat 4
    go
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
With this new command, the above code simplifies to 

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
right
foursteps
get
right
foursteps
get
right
foursteps
get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
There are still repetitions that must be eliminated! So we define a new command 
{\tt walkedge}:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def walkedge
  right
  foursteps
  get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Now with the new commands {\tt foursteps} and
{\tt walkedge}, our program simplifies to:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
while not home
  walkedge
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
It is the task of the first exercise in this Section to implement this program. But before we 
do so, let us mention one very important thing.

\subsection{Solution procedure revisited (and corrected)}

Let's forget the commands that we defined above.
Experienced programmer would never approach the problem the way we did.
He (or she but let's use "he" for simplicity) 
would first look at the problem, trying to recognize repeating patterns. 
He would find that the task can be fulfilled by repeating one simpler task 
three times. So, without knowing exactly how the smaller task is going to 
be solved, he would write:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
while not home
  walkedge
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Next he would define the new command {\tt walkedge} as follows:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def walkedge
  right
  foursteps
  get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
He would not bother defining the command 
{\tt foursteps} yet, because he knows that this will be 
simple. And as the last step, to make the program work, he would 
define:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def foursteps
  repeat 4
    go
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item When should a new command be defined?
\item What will happen when we copy and paste the same code 
      to multiple places in our program?
\item Write a new command {\tt emptybag} that empties Karel's bag.
\item Write a new command {\tt turnsouth} that turns Karel to the South no matter 
      which direction he is facing.

\section{Section G - Logical Variables}

In programming, variables are used to store information for later use. This information can 
be a number, word, sentence, or simply a "True" or "False". We will start
with the last type. 

\subsection{Simple logical expressions}
Logical expressions are expressions that can be answered with either "True" or 
"False". We say that the "True" or the "False" is their value. Here are some 
real-life examples, try to answer them with "True" or "False":

\begin{itemize}
\item "I am 15 years old."
\item "My dad is a teacher."
\item "My school's name is Coral Academy."
\end{itemize}
And here are some Karel examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item wall (True if the robot is facing a wall, False otherwise)
\item home (True if the robot is home, False otherwise)
\item gem (True if the robot stands on a gem, False otherwise)
\item north (True if the robot is facing North, False otherwise)
\item empty (True if the robot does not have any gems on him, False otherwise)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical operations and logical variables}

In programming as well as in real life we often deal with logical expressions that are 
fairly complex. Often we use two or more simple logical expressions in one sentence, that 
are combined via logical operations.

For example, the sentence "I will go ski on Saturday if weather is good and if 
Michael goes as well." includes three simple logical expressions. Let's call 
them for brevity

\begin{itemize}
\item A = "I will go skiing on Saturday",
\item B = "the weather is good",
\item C = "Michael goes as well".  
\end{itemize}
There is also a logical operation "and" involved between the expressions B and C.

The original sentence can be written briefly as "if (B and C) then A". We love this kind of 
brevity in programming! The letters A, B and C are logical variables. Logical variables 
can only represent "True" or "False", and their purpose is to ease the operation with 
longer expressions.
Regarding the original sentence, we could go one step further and define a new logical variable\\

\noindent
D = B and C.\\

\noindent
Then, the sentence would become "if D then A". It is worth mentioning the following 
property of the logical "and":\\

\begin{center}
\framebox{(A and B) is True only if both A and B are True. Otherwise A and B is False.}
\end{center}
\vspace{4mm}
\noindent
We also have a logical "or" with the following property:\\

\begin{center}
\framebox{(A or B) is True if at least one of A, B is True. If both A. B are False, (A or B) is False.}
\end{center}
\vspace{4mm}
\noindent
We also use the logical operation "not" with the following property:\\

\begin{center}
\framebox{(not A) is True if A is False and vice versa.}
\end{center}


\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are {\em variables} used for in programming? 
\item What is a {\em logical expression}? 
\item A is True and B is False. What is then the value of (A and not (A or B)) ?
\item A is True and B is True. What is then the value of (A and not (A and not B)) ?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise G01 - Numerology I}

{\em Each box contains an integer number between 0 and 9. The numbers are not known to Karel a-priori. He needs to enter each box and recognize the number in it. Let's call this number N. When he leaves the box, he needs to create a pile of N gems. The task finishes when this is done for all boxes and the robot gets home.}

\subsection{Exercise G02 - Numerology II}

{\em There is a pile of N gems before the entrance to the box. It is known that N is between zero and 9. Karel needs to enter the box and render the number N. The task finishes when this is done and the robot gets home.}

\subsection{Exercise G03 - Numerology III}

{\em Add the numbers! Remember - Karel cannot see what numbers are in the boxes as you can see them. They can be any integers between 0 and 9. The task finishes when the robot gets home.}

\subsection{Exercise G04 - Eight Queens}

{\em Karel stands on an 8 x 8 chess board along with eight queens (the gems). Recall that a chess queen dominates its row, its column, as well as both diagonals that pass through her position. Nothing may stand in these fields or she will destroy it. Currently, some queens are threatening each other. Write a program for Karel to correct the positions of the queens in such a way that none of them is threatened. Your program should be able to do it for any initial distribution of the queens. Enter the home after you are finished.}

\subsection{Exercise G05 - BubbleSort}

{\em Karel stands in front of four piles of gems, let's enumerate them by 1, 2, 3 and 4. He does not know how many gems are in each pile. All he knows is that each pile contains between 1 and 4 gems, and that two or more piles can be equally large. Sort the piles in such a way that the smallest pile is on the left and the largest on the right. Use the BubbleSort algorithm: Implement a function that switches two adjacent piles if the one on the right has fewer gems than the one on the left. Apply this function to piles 1 and 2, then to piles 2 and 3, then to piles 3 and 4. Now it is certain that the largest number is on the right-most position! Next, do the same for just the first three piles. Last, apply the function to piles 1 and 2, and you are done! }

\section{What Next?}

Congratulations on making it to the end of the tutorial! We hope that you
enjoyed it. If you can think of any ways to improve the application 
Karel the Robot in NCLab or this tutorial, please let us know. If you 
have an interesting game for Karel, please let us know as well. 

Although you may feel like an Almighty Programmer right now, we would
recommend staying humble. Even the most experienced programmers are
learning new things all the time. If you enjoy programming, your next 
language to learn may be Python. We have a Python Programming tutorial
in NCLab for you. We would also recommend that you learn Javascript since this 
is the most popular language for web development. Depending on your 
other hobbies or interests, C++ or even Fortran might be interesting. 
In any case, the NCLab Team wishes you good luck, and keep us in your 
favorite bookmarks!\\
