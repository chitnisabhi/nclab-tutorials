\subsection*{NCLab's Karel vs. the Original Version}
This publication features {\em Karel the Robot}, a programming language 
designed by Richard E. Pattis. Compared to its original version that was
strongly influenced by Pascal, the NCLab version is closer to Python.
There are some other differences as well that make Karel in NCLab easier to use 
for kids -- Karel collects gems instead of beepers, he has a home in the 
maze, and he uses commands that are much easier for kids to understand
and type. For example, {\tt pickbeeper} was replaced with {\tt get}, 
{\tt front-is-clear} was replaced with {\tt wall}, etc. Python 
colons following every command are omitted because using the SHIFT key 
was causing difficulties to some 5 years old programmers. 
Otherwise we have not changed Pattis' original ideas and all functionality 
covered in Pattis' book is available in the Basic Version free of charge.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Objectives} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Learn basic facts about the Karel language and its history. 
\item Learn how Karel differs from other programming languages.
\item Learn what this course will help you achieve.
\end{itemize}
This course will teach you principles of modern algorithmic design and  
computer programming with the help of an interactive graphical application 
{\em Karel the Robot} in NCLab. Taking this course will make it much easier 
for you to learn Python, C, C++ and other advanced programming languages. In particular we 
recommend that after Karel you continue with Python, a powerful programming 
language that is used across all science and engineering areas, and yet it is 
technically simpler to handle than C or C++. The textbook
{\em Python Programming for Beginners} is available in PDF via the link 
"Tutorials and Videos" on NCLab home page.

\subsection{Brief history}

Karel the Robot is a famous educational programming language that was introduced by Richard E. 
Pattis in his book "Karel The Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Programming" in 1981. 
Pattis first used the language in his courses at Stanford University, and now it is used at 
countless schools in the world to introduce students to algorithmic design and computer programming. 
The language is named after Karel \v{C}apek, a Czech writer who invented the word "robot" in his 1921 
science fiction play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).

\subsection{Who is Karel?}

Karel is a little robot that lives in a maze, and there are gems in the maze that he loves to collect!
He was manufactured with only five simple commands in his memory:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{green} \tt go} ... make one step forward.
\item {\color{green} \tt get} ... pick up a gem from the ground. 
\item {\color{green} \tt left} ... turn to the left.
\item {\color{green} \tt right} ... turn to the right. 
\item {\color{green} \tt put} ... put a gem on the ground. 
\end{itemize}
He also has five built-in sensors that allow him to check his immediate surroundings:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{green} \tt wall} ... true if he would crash into a wall by making one more step, false otherwise. 
\item {\color{green} \tt gem} ... true if he stands on a gem, false otherwise.
\item {\color{green} \tt north} ... true if he is facing North, false otherwise.
\item {\color{green} \tt home} ... true if he is at home, false otherwise.
\item {\color{green} \tt empty} ... true if his bag with gems is empty, false otherwise. 
\end{itemize}
During this course you will help Karel solve many exciting tasks starting with very simple ones and 
gradually progressing to more challenging. In this way Karel becomes a great robot, and you 
will become a great programmer!

\subsection{Why should I take this course?}

Computer programming skills are highly valued today, and they will be even more 
valued in the future. Karel's language is so natural that you will be able to 
focus on designing great algorithms. This is the most important skill in 
computer programming. In other words, you could start learning programming 
with a technically 
complicated conventional programming language as well, but you would spend lots of time 
battling technical problems. The advantage of starting with Karel is that 
when moving on to other languages, you will be able to focus on the technical 
differences, as the programming concepts you will already understand.


\subsection{Is Karel a toy language?}

Definitely not! Despite its playful appearance, Karel contains all elements 
of modern procedural programming. The complexity of algorithms 
that you will encounter in this course ranges from {\em extremely simple} 
to {\em extremely tough}. Towards the end of this course you will encounter 
tasks that will make your head spin. However, Karel is very light on 
technicalities, which is very good for someone who is just starting out.

The biggest conceptual difference between Karel and standard procedural
programming languages such as Python, C, C++ or Fortran is that {\em the robot does not 
know math}. At least not until we get to advanced levels that are beyond 
the original Pattis' book. In the basic course, you will solve many exercises 
whose objective is to teach you how to design great algorithms, and math is 
not needed for that. After finishing this tutorial, you will be able to transition 
smoothly to Python where you can do as much math as you like!

\section{Exploring NCLab}

\subsection{Objectives} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Get acquainted with NCLab.
\end{itemize}
Before beginning this course, we invite you to create an account in 
NCLab, log in, and take a while to explore the many activities 
that NCLab offers. A great companion reading is {\em Intro to NCLab - Part I 
(Meet the Cloud)} that is available in PDF via the link "Tutorials and Videos"
on NCLab home page {\tt http://nclab.com}.

\subsection{Review questions}

Review questions for this Section are located in the document {\em Intro to NCLab - Part I 
(Meet the Cloud)}.

\section{Launching Karel}

\subsection{Objectives} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to launch Karel and work with the graphical application.
\item Learn to clone displayed projects.
\item Learn that karel has several modes.
\end{itemize}
Karel can be launched in several different ways. The simplest one is to click on the icon 
{\em Programming} and select {\em Karel} in the menu. This will launch the application 
with a randomly generated maze, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:init}.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/init.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Launching Karel via the Programming icon.}
\label{fig:init}
\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\noindent
Karel will be launched in {\em Programming mode} which is the most-frequently 
used one. You can easily switch to the {\em Manual mode}, {\em Builder},
and {\em Game mode} in the menu. Game mode is available in Full Version only. 
These modes will be discussed in Paragraph \ref{levels}.

\subsection{Karel's window} \label{menu}

The application window contains two lines of menus and information on top,
work area on the left, maze on the right, and status bar on the bottom.
The menus are fairly intuitive, so let us just explain a few selected functions, starting 
with the {\em File} menu:

{\em Open} will open a file from your NCLab account (not from your hard disk). {\em New} will generate a new random maze.
{\em Clone} will copy a Displayed Project into your account (to be discussed in Paragraph \ref{cloning}). 
{\em Display} will submit your project for review. If you think that 
      other users would find your program or game interesting, this is the way to make it 
      available to them. Upon passing the review, your project will be added to Displayed Projects.

{\em Edit} menu allows you to operate with input and text cells (to be discussed in 
Section \ref{sec:editmenu}). In {\em Settings} you can change Karel's {\em Level} (to be discussed
in Paragraph \ref{levels}), change his speed, and adjust sound preferences. The blue arrow and square 
buttons are used to run and stop programs, and the two buttons next to them can be used to increase and decrease 
font size. The pair of icons on far right is the step counter (that can be reset by clicking on it) and 
gem counter that indicates how many gems Karel has in his bag.

\subsection{Cloning Displayed Projects} \label{cloning}

All programs and exercises that we will work with are
available for you to clone. To do this, 
click on the File Manager icon. In the File Manager's menu go to 
{\em Project} and then click on {\em Clone}. This will launch a new window 
with Displayed Projects as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cloning}.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/cloning.png}
\end{center}
%\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{File Manager's {\em Project} menu allows you to clone many Karel projects.}
\label{fig:cloning}
\end{figure}
\noindent
All projects whose names start with "Karel - Exercise" are of particular interest 
for this tutorial. Their solutions have names starting with "Karel - Solution". 
Any of them can be cloned into your account via clicking on the project name in the window, 
and pressing the button {\em Clone}.

In the File Manager's right-hand side panel, you will see the list of all 
projects that you cloned. Click on any of them to launch it. You are free to 
use the cloned projects as they are, or modify them in any way you like. Your 
modifications will not affect the original. And, you can 
always synchronize your version with the original, via 
a right-click on the project in the File Manager and selecting {\em Synchronize}.
Keep in mind though -- synchronizing with the original will erase any changes that 
you made to the project.

%\subsection{Basic and Full Versions}
%
%Users sponsored by an institution are using NCLab in Full Version. Some limitations 
%apply to users who use NCLab in Basic Version (see Terms of Use for details). These 
%users have an Upgrade icon on their Desktop, that they can use to upgrade 
%NCLab to Full Version for a symbolic monthly subscription fee.

\subsection{Karel modes} \label{levels}

Karel operates in four modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Manual mode:} The robot is controlled using the mouse and five buttons Go, Get, Left, Right, and Put. 
      Watch out and do not crash!
\item {\em Program mode:} The robot is controlled using written programs (computer code). The Program mode is 
      split into several Levels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Level 1 is a transition layer between the Manual and Programming modes. Programs are written using only 
      five commands {\tt go}, {\tt get}, {\tt left}, {\tt right}, and {\tt put} that exactly correspond to 
      the buttons Go, Get, Left, Right, and Put in Manual mode.
\item Level 2 is where the actual programming begins. On top of the commands from Level 1, programs can contain 
      conditions, loops, and custom commands.
\item Level 3 teaches the user to operate with logical and numerical variables, and with computer memory. Karel  
      also has receives a GPS device. This Level is in preparation.
\item Level 4 teaches the basics of object-oriented programming. This Level is in preparation.
\item Level 5 teaches the basics of parallel programming. This Level is in preparation.
\end{itemize}
\item {\em Build mode:} This mode allows the user to create custom mazes.
\item {\em Game mode:} Makes it possible to create and play games. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What can you do with a displayed Karel project that you clone into your account?.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] View but not run.
\item[A2] View and run but not edit.
\item[A3] View, run and edit but not save.
\item[A4] View, run, edit, save, whatever, they are all yours!
\end{enumerate}
\item What are the four modes of the Karel application?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] Manual mode, Build mode, Program mode, Game mode.
\item[A2] Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3, Mode 4.
\item[A3] Beginner mode, Intermediate mode, Advanced mode, Expert mode.
\item[A4] Karel has no modes.
\end{enumerate}
\item What is the difference between Levels 1 and 2?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] In Level 2 the robot has more sensors. 
\item[A2] In Level 2 one can only guide the robot with the mouse.
\item[A3] In Level 2 one can only use 5 commands.
\item[A4] In Level 2 programs can contain 
      conditions, loops, and custom commands.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Intermission - Algorithms, Programs, and Bugs}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the difference between {\em algorithm} and {\em program}. 
\item Learn the difference between {\em syntactical} and {\em logical} mistakes.
\item Understand that {\em debugging} is an indivisible part of computer programming.
\end{itemize}
Karel always obeys all commands {\em precisely}. Sometimes it may happen that 
we plan one thing but to our surprise the robot does something else. In most cases this 
happens when our {\em algorithm} is wrong. By an {\em algorithm} we mean a sequence of 
logical steps that the robot needs to follow in order to fulfill his task. Algorithms 
are presented using normal human language, not in terms of the robot's commands. 

{\em Program} or {\em computer code} is created when the algorithm is expressed
in terms of the robot's language. When our algorithm is good, then 
the program is easy to write.

Mistakes in algorithms are called {\em logical errors}. A logical error is, for 
example, when we crash the robot into a wall because we forgot to make a turn.
Mistakes such as mis-spelling a command or forgetting indentation are related to 
the {\em syntax} and they are called {\em syntactical errors}. Of these two types, 
logical errors are usually much more difficult to find. 

In general, mistakes or either kind are called {\em bugs} and the procedure of 
eliminating them is called {\em debugging}. Depending on how careful we 
were while preparing our algorithm and writing the program, debugging takes either 
a short time or a long time. It does not happen often that a program works correctly
right away. 

When we commit a syntactical error (such as mis-spelling a command)
the robot will write an error message without doing anything else.
If our algorithm contains a logical error based on which the robot crashes 
into a wall, if we ask him to collect a gem where there is none, or if we 
ask him to put a gem on the ground while his bag is empty, then he will
write an error message and stop executing the program.

\section{Section C - Counting Loop}

\subsection{Objectives} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to make the robot repeat a command or a sequence of commands.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In Section B we successfully crossed the bridge between manual control 
and programming. The bridge collapsed, there is no way back. But do 
not worry about that, the land of Programming is much more beautiful!


\subsection{The {\tt repeat} command}

The counting loop, represented by the {\tt repeat} command, can save 
us lots of writing when something is repeated. For example, for 
Karel to make seven steps forward we could type:

\begin{verbatim}
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
\end{verbatim}
But this is neither efficient nor elegant. Instead, the same can be
achieved by telling Karel to {\tt repeat} the {\tt go} command {\tt 7} times:

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 7
  go
\end{verbatim}
There are a few simple rules that we need to remember when using the {\tt repeat} command:

\begin{itemize}
\item Keep code readable -- always write one command per line.
\item Indentation -- all commands to be repeated (the {\em body of the loop}) need to be indented. You can
      choose whether you prefer 2-indents or 4-indents. The former yields more compact 
      code with not-so-long lines, the latter is easier to read. 
\item Cancel the indentation for the first command that does not belong to the body of the loop.
\end{itemize}
To illustrate what the indentation does, let's look at a code that will move the robot 8 steps forward:

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 4
  go
  go
\end{verbatim}
Compare to a code that will only move the robot 5 steps forward:

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 4
  go
go
\end{verbatim}
Multiple {\tt repeat} commands can be {\em nested}. This means that a {\tt repeat} command 
can used in the body of another {\tt repeat} command. Everything that was said about indentation 
still holds. Can you figure out what the following code does?

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 10
  repeat 5
    go
  repeat 2
    left
\end{verbatim}
After you figure it out, launch Karel via the {\em Programming} menu, enter this code into
the input cell, and run it! But before you do, remember to switch to Builder and make 
some free space around the robot 
so that he does not crash into a wall.

\section{Intermission - Working with Input and Text Cells} \label{sec:editmenu}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn why descriptive text cells are useful and how to insert them.
\item Learn when it makes sense to have multiple input cells and how to add them.
\item Learn how to run all input cells at once, and how to run them individually.
\item Learn how to clear, remove and merge cells.
\end{itemize}
There are a couple of simple new rules to remember:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Programs are entered into input cells on the left (one will appear after you press Start).
\item Always type one command per line -- this does not hold only for Karel but for any
      programming language. It makes computer code much easier to read.
\item Clicking on "clear" under an input cell will erase its contents.
\item You can add a new input cell by clicking on "add" (located under each input cell). 
      Having multiple input cells can be useful, for example, to test various versions 
      of your program, or if you want to run parts of your program separately. 
\item Clicking on "remove" under an input cell will remove it. All text in that cell will be lost.
\item Run programs via the blue arrow button in the menu (this will evaluate all input
      cells). Each cell can be evaluated individually by clicking on "run" (located under 
      each input cell). If there is just one input cell, both options are equivalent.
\item Running programs can be stopped using the blue square button in the menu.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
\item How should running programs be stopped?

\item[A1] Click on the blue arrow button.
\item[A2] Close the main Karel window.
\item[A3] Click on the blue square button.
\item[A4] Click on "stop" under the last input cell.
\end{enumerate}
\item How can we evaluate just one selected input cell?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] We have to copy and paste the contents of all 
          input cells into the first one, and remove them.
\item[A2] Clicking on the blue arrow button in the menu. 
\item[A3] Clicking on "run" under the input cell.
\item[A4] Clicking on "remove" under the input cell.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}




\section{Section D - Conditions}

\subsection{Objectives} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the function of Karel's five sensors.
\item Learn to use the sensors in conjunction with {\em conditions} to help Karel 
      check his surroundings and react accordingly. For example, you will learn to first 
      check whether wall is ahead before making a step forward, checking whether there
      is a gem on the ground before attempting to pick it up, etc.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Karel has built-in sensors to better navigate in the maze:

\subsection{Karel's five sensors}

The first one is an infrared sensor that the robot uses to determine 
whether it is safe to make one step forward, or whether there is a wall.
The usage can be illustrated using a simple program "Careful step" 
where Karel first checks whether there is a wall ahead before
making a step. If there is wall, he turns back: 

\begin{verbatim}
# Program "Careful step".
if wall
  repeat 2
    left
else
  go
\end{verbatim}
Note that the symbol {\tt \#} introduces a comment, meaning that the line 
of code behind it is ignored by the robot.
The {\tt else} branch does not have to be there if it is not needed. Notice the indentation 
of the bodies of the {\tt if} and {\tt else} branches - this is analogous 
to how we indent the body of the {\tt repeat} command.

Besides {\tt wall}, the robot can check the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt gem} ... is there a gem where he stands?
\item {\tt empty} ... is his bag with gems empty?
\item {\tt north} ... is he facing North?
\item {\tt home} ... is he at home?
\end{itemize}
Karel can also use the reserved word {\tt not} to test the opposites.
For illustration, the previous program can be rewritten as follows, without changing its function:
\begin{verbatim}
# Program "Careful step".
if not wall
  go
else
  repeat 2
    left
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Programming wisdom}

Good programmer is a careful programmer! Errors can be avoided by always checking the 
appropriate sensor before making an action. A few examples of careful actions:
 
\begin{verbatim}
if not wall
  go
\end{verbatim}
Another example:
 
\begin{verbatim}
if gem
  get
\end{verbatim}
And a last one:
 
\begin{verbatim}
if not empty
  put
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the five sensors that Karel can use, and what do they do?
\item Can he  see from where he stands whether a wall is two steps ahead?
\item Can he check without turning whether a wall is on his right?
\item Can he check from where he stands whether a gem is one step away?
\item Can he check from where he stands whether his home is one step away?
\item Can he check whether he has at least one gem in the bag?
\item Can he check without turning whether he faces West?
\item Write a program for Karel to check whether Karel stands on a gem, and if so, to pick it up.
\item Write a program for Karel to check whether his bag is not empty, and if not, to put one gem on the ground. 
\item Write a program for Karel to turn North. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise D01 - In the Fog}

{\em Several gems lie on the ground between the robot and his home which is 10 steps away. 
He cannot see where they are exactly since his sensor only tells him if a gem is right 
under him.  And besides that, nothing is visible in today's foggy weather anyway. 
Write a program for Karel to collect all gems and get home. With one command per 
line, your program should have at most 4 lines.}

\section{Section E - Conditional Loop}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to repeat a command or a sequence of commands when it is not known 
      how many repetitions will be needed.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In this section we will learn another type of loop that is highly useful 
in programming.

\subsection{The {\tt while} command}

Often Karel needs to repeat something, {\em not knowing in advance how many repetitions
there will be}. This can be the case, for example, 
when he is asked to walk straight ahead until he reaches the closest wall.
Remember that he only can see walls that are right ahead of him; walls 
that are further away he can't see. Such a program would be:

\begin{verbatim}
while not wall
  go
\end{verbatim}
Or, he may be asked to walk until he gets home:

\begin{verbatim}
while not home
  go
\end{verbatim}
Or, he may be asked to empty his bag (he does not know how many gems are in it): 
 
\begin{verbatim}
while not empty
  put
\end{verbatim}
Or, he may be asked to collect all gems from a pile (he does not know 
how many gems there are):

\begin{verbatim}
while gem
  get
\end{verbatim}
Or we may ask him to turn to face North (he does not know which direction he is
facing):

\begin{verbatim}
while not north
  left
\end{verbatim}
At last, Karel is asked to 
turn South, walk straight ahead until he reaches the closest wall, and 
collect all gems that he can find on the way:

\begin{verbatim}
# First turn North.
while not north
  left

# Then turn South.
repeat 2
  left

# Go straight ahead and pick all gems.
while not wall
  if gem
    get
  go

# Pick gem at the wall (if any).
if gem
  get
\end{verbatim}
Notice that we first need to turn the robot to face North -- this is because North 
is the only direction that he can check!

\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the difference between the {\tt repeat} and {\tt while} loops?
\item Write a program for Karel to turn North {\em not using} the {\tt while} loop. 
\item Then write a program for Karel to turn North {\em using} the {\tt while} loop. 
      Compare the length and elegance of this program with the one from the 
      previous question.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise E01 - South West}

{\em Karel is lost and he does not even know whether he is facing north, south, east or west! He only knows that his home is in the south-west corner of the maze. Write a program for the robot to get there. Hint: First you need to orient the robot to face north, that's the only direction that he can check with his sensors.}

\subsection{Exercise E02 - Hide-and-Seek}

{\em Karel's friends are hiding. He knows that he has to go straight 
ahead to find them. When he finds a gem, he has to turn left and keep 
walking. Eventually, he will get to the place where his friends are 
hiding. If he gets home, stop. Write a program for Karel to do this, 
and do not forget to collect all the gems on the way!}

\section{Section F - Defining New Commands}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to never copy and paste computer code.
\item Learn to recognize smaller tasks that can be solved without solving the big task.
\item Learn to bring more structure and clarity into your programs by introducing new commands.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Programming wisdom}

{\em Always look for small tasks that can be solved independently of the big ones.
Solve the small tasks first, and you'll see that the big ones get much simpler. The 
importance of what we just said cannot be stressed more. Please read these three 
lines once more.}\\

\noindent
The fact that you are reading this line of text proves that you are not 
a perfect programmer yet. Otherwise you would be stuck forever in the 
previous infinite loop!

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/smiley.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}


\subsection{More programming wisdom}

A new command should be defined whenever it becomes clear that the same 
action is repeated in the algorithm multiple times (yes, we talk about the algorithm,
not about the program). If you start writing a program and then realize that the same
code repeats itself at various places, then probably you did not do a good job 
designing the algorithm.

Sometimes it might be 
tempting to just copy and paste the same code several times in the 
program, because it does the same thing, but never do it! This would be very bad programming
and sooner or later your own code would punish you for that. 
You would make a small change at one place but forget to do it 
in all the other places. Then your code would start 
acting strange, it would sometimes work and sometimes fail. 
You would spend lots of time looking for the mistakes, find some 
of them but not all, and your program would become unreliable
and after some time irreparable. You would find that you need to 
rewrite it from scratch.

\subsection{Defining new commands}

New commands are defined using the reserved word 
{\tt def}. For example, in a program where the robot needs to turn back
many times, it is a good idea to define a new command {\tt back}
as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
def back
  repeat 2
    left
\end{verbatim}
Note the indent -- the body of a new command needs to be indented 
analogously to the bodies of loops and conditions.

\subsection{Revisiting exercise A07}

Let us return to the exercise A07 - Right Button for a moment.
A really bad program to solve this task would be:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
right
go
go
go
go 
get
right
go
go
go
go 
get
right
go
go
go
go
get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Can you see how many times the same code is repeated?! In order to fix this, 
we should define new command {\tt foursteps} as
follows:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def foursteps
  repeat 4
    go
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
With this new command, the above code simplifies to 

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
right
foursteps
get
right
foursteps
get
right
foursteps
get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
There are still repetitions that must be eliminated! So we define a new command 
{\tt walkedge}:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def walkedge
  right
  foursteps
  get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Now with the new commands {\tt foursteps} and
{\tt walkedge}, our program simplifies to:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
while not home
  walkedge
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
It is the task of the first exercise in this Section to implement this program. But before we 
do so, let us mention one very important thing.

\subsection{Solution procedure revisited (and corrected)}

Let's forget the commands that we defined above.
Experienced programmer would never approach the problem the way we did.
He (or she but let's use "he" for simplicity) 
would first look at the problem, trying to recognize repeating patterns. 
He would find that the task can be fulfilled by repeating one simpler task 
three times. So, without knowing exactly how the smaller task is going to 
be solved, he would write:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
while not home
  walkedge
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Next he would define the new command {\tt walkedge} as follows:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def walkedge
  right
  foursteps
  get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
He would not bother defining the command 
{\tt foursteps} yet, because he knows that this will be 
simple. And as the last step, to make the program work, he would 
define:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def foursteps
  repeat 4
    go
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item When should a new command be defined?
\item What will happen when we copy and paste the same code 
      to multiple places in our program?
\item Write a new command {\tt emptybag} that empties Karel's bag.
\item Write a new command {\tt turnsouth} that turns Karel to the South no matter 
      which direction he is facing.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Section G - Logical Variables}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to work with elementary and complex logical operations.
\item Learn to define and use logical variables.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In programming, variables are used to store information for later use. This information can 
be a number, word, sentence, or simply a "True" or "False". We will start
with the last type. 

\subsection{Simple logical expressions}
Logical expressions are expressions that can be answered with either "True" or 
"False". We say that the "True" or the "False" is their value. Here are some 
real-life examples, try to answer them with "True" or "False":

\begin{itemize}
\item "I am 15 years old."
\item "My dad is a teacher."
\item "My school's name is Coral Academy."
\end{itemize}
And here are some Karel examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item wall (True if the robot is facing a wall, False otherwise)
\item home (True if the robot is home, False otherwise)
\item gem (True if the robot stands on a gem, False otherwise)
\item north (True if the robot is facing North, False otherwise)
\item empty (True if the robot does not have any gems on him, False otherwise)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical operations and logical variables}

In programming as well as in real life we often deal with logical expressions that are 
fairly complex. Often we use two or more simple logical expressions in one sentence, that 
are combined via logical operations.

For example, the sentence "I will go ski on Saturday if weather is good and if 
Michael goes as well." includes three simple logical expressions. Let's call 
them for brevity

\begin{itemize}
\item A = "I will go skiing on Saturday",
\item B = "the weather is good",
\item C = "Michael goes as well".  
\end{itemize}
There is also a logical operation "and" involved between the expressions B and C.

The original sentence can be written briefly as "if (B and C) then A". We love this kind of 
brevity in programming! The letters A, B and C are logical variables. Logical variables 
can only represent "True" or "False", and their purpose is to ease the operation with 
longer expressions.
Regarding the original sentence, we could go one step further and define a new logical variable\\

\noindent
D = B and C.\\

\noindent
Then, the sentence would become "if D then A". It is worth mentioning the following 
property of the logical "and":\\

\begin{center}
\framebox{(A and B) is True only if both A and B are True. Otherwise A and B is False.}
\end{center}
\vspace{4mm}
\noindent
We also have a logical "or" with the following property:\\

\begin{center}
\framebox{(A or B) is True if at least one of A, B is True. If both A. B are False, (A or B) is False.}
\end{center}
\vspace{4mm}
\noindent
We also use the logical operation "not" with the following property:\\

\begin{center}
\framebox{(not A) is True if A is False and vice versa.}
\end{center}


\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are {\em variables} used for in programming? 
\item What is a {\em logical expression}? 
\item A is True and B is False. What is then the value of (A and not (A or B)) ?
\item A is True and B is True. What is then the value of (A and not (A and not B)) ?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise G01 - Numerology I}

{\em Each box contains an integer number between 0 and 9. The numbers are not known to Karel a-priori. He needs to enter each box and recognize the number in it. Let's call this number N. When he leaves the box, he needs to create a pile of N gems. The task finishes when this is done for all boxes and the robot gets home.}

\subsection{Exercise G04 - Eight Queens}

{\em Karel stands on an 8 x 8 chess board along with eight queens (the gems). Recall that a chess queen dominates its row, its column, as well as both diagonals that pass through her position. Nothing may stand in these fields or she will destroy it. Currently, some queens are threatening each other. Write a program for Karel to correct the positions of the queens in such a way that none of them is threatened. Your program should be able to do it for any initial distribution of the queens. Enter the home after you are finished.}

\subsection{Exercise G05 - BubbleSort}

{\em Karel stands in front of four piles of gems, let's enumerate them by 1, 2, 3 and 4. He does not know how many gems are in each pile. All he knows is that each pile contains between 1 and 4 gems, and that two or more piles can be equally large. Sort the piles in such a way that the smallest pile is on the left and the largest on the right. Use the BubbleSort algorithm: Implement a function that switches two adjacent piles if the one on the right has fewer gems than the one on the left. Apply this function to piles 1 and 2, then to piles 2 and 3, then to piles 3 and 4. Now it is certain that the largest number is on the right-most position! Next, do the same for just the first three piles. Last, apply the function to piles 1 and 2, and you are done! }
