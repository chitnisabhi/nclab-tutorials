\subsection*{NCLab's Karel vs. the Original Version}
This publication features {\em Karel the Robot}, a programming language 
designed by Richard E. Pattis. Compared to its original version that was
strongly influenced by Pascal, the NCLab version is closer to Python.
There are some other differences as well that make Karel in NCLab easier to use 
for kids -- Karel collects gems instead of beepers, he has a home in the 
maze, and he uses commands that are much easier for kids to understand
and type. For example, {\tt pickbeeper} was replaced with {\tt get}, 
{\tt front-is-clear} was replaced with {\tt wall}, etc. Python 
colons following every command are omitted because using the SHIFT key 
was causing difficulties to some 5 years old programmers. 
Otherwise we have not changed Pattis' original ideas and all functionality 
covered in Pattis' book is available in the Basic Version free of charge.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Objectives} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Learn basic facts about the Karel language and its history. 
\item Learn how Karel differs from other programming languages.
\item Learn what this course will help you achieve.
\end{itemize}
This course will teach you principles of modern algorithmic design and  
computer programming with the help of an interactive graphical application 
{\em Karel the Robot} in NCLab. Taking this course will make it much easier 
for you to learn Python, C, C++ and other advanced programming languages. In particular we 
recommend that after Karel you continue with Python, a powerful programming 
language that is used across all science and engineering areas, and yet it is 
technically simpler to handle than C or C++. The textbook
{\em Python Programming for Beginners} is available in PDF via the link 
"Tutorials and Videos" on NCLab home page.

\subsection{Brief history}

Karel the Robot is a famous educational programming language that was introduced by Richard E. 
Pattis in his book "Karel The Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Programming" in 1981. 
Pattis first used the language in his courses at Stanford University, and now it is used at 
countless schools in the world to introduce students to algorithmic design and computer programming. 
The language is named after Karel \v{C}apek, a Czech writer who invented the word "robot" in his 1921 
science fiction play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).

\subsection{Who is Karel?}

Karel is a little robot that lives in a maze, and there are gems in the maze that he loves to collect!
Sometimes multiple gems lie on each other, and in that case there is a number that shows their amount.
He was manufactured with only five simple commands in his memory:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{green} \tt go} ... make one step forward.
\item {\color{green} \tt get} ... pick up a gem from the ground. 
\item {\color{green} \tt left} ... turn to the left.
\item {\color{green} \tt right} ... turn to the right. 
\item {\color{green} \tt put} ... put a gem on the ground. 
\end{itemize}
He also has five built-in sensors that allow him to check his immediate surroundings:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{green} \tt wall} ... true if he would crash into a wall by making one more step, false otherwise. 
\item {\color{green} \tt gem} ... true if he stands on a gem, false otherwise.
\item {\color{green} \tt north} ... true if he is facing North, false otherwise.
\item {\color{green} \tt home} ... true if he is at home, false otherwise.
\item {\color{green} \tt empty} ... true if his bag with gems is empty, false otherwise. 
\end{itemize}
During this course you will help Karel solve many exciting tasks starting with very simple ones and 
gradually progressing to more challenging. In this way Karel becomes a great robot, and you 
will become a great programmer!

\subsection{Why should I take this course?}

Computer programming skills are highly valued today, and they will be even more 
valued in the future. Karel's language is so natural that you will be able to 
focus on designing great algorithms. This is the most important skill in 
computer programming. In other words, you could start learning programming 
with a technically 
complicated conventional programming language as well, but you would spend lots of time 
battling technical problems. The advantage of starting with Karel is that 
when moving on to other languages, you will be able to focus on the technical 
differences, as the programming concepts you will already understand.


\subsection{Is Karel a toy language?}

Definitely not! Despite its playful appearance, Karel contains all elements 
of modern procedural programming. The complexity of algorithms 
that you will encounter in this course ranges from {\em extremely simple} 
to {\em extremely tough}. Towards the end of this course you will encounter 
tasks that will make your head spin. However, Karel is very light on 
technicalities, which is very good for someone who is just starting out.

The biggest conceptual difference between Karel and standard procedural
programming languages such as Python, C, C++ or Fortran is that {\em the robot does not 
know math}. At least not until we get to advanced levels that are beyond 
the original Pattis' book. In the basic course, you will solve many exercises 
whose objective is to teach you how to design great algorithms, and math is 
not needed for that. After finishing this tutorial, you will be able to transition 
smoothly to Python where you can do as much math as you like!

\section{Exploring NCLab}

\subsection{Objectives} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Get acquainted with NCLab.
\end{itemize}
Before beginning this course, we invite you to create an account in 
NCLab, log in, and take a while to explore the many activities 
that NCLab offers. A great companion reading is {\em Intro to NCLab - Part I 
(Meet the Cloud)} that is available in PDF via the link "Tutorials and Videos"
on NCLab home page {\tt http://nclab.com}.

\subsection{Review questions}

Review questions for this Section are located in the document {\em Intro to NCLab - Part I 
(Meet the Cloud)}.

\section{Launching Karel}

\subsection{Objectives} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to launch Karel and work with the graphical application.
\item Learn to clone displayed projects.
\item Learn that Karel has several modes.
\end{itemize}
Karel can be launched in several different ways. The simplest one is to click on the icon 
{\em Programming} and select {\em Karel} in the menu. This will launch the application 
with a randomly generated maze, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:init}.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/init.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Launching Karel via the Programming icon.}
\label{fig:init}
\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\noindent
Karel will be launched in {\em Programming mode} which is the most-frequently 
used one. You can easily switch to the {\em Manual mode}, {\em Build mode},
and {\em Game mode} in the menu. Game mode is available in Full Version only. 
These modes will be discussed in Paragraph \ref{levels}.

\subsection{Karel's window} \label{menu}

The application window contains two lines of menus and information on top,
work area on the left, maze on the right, and status bar on the bottom.
The menus are fairly intuitive, so let us just explain a few selected functions, starting 
with the {\em File} menu:

{\em Open} will open a file from your NCLab account (not from your hard disk). {\em New} will generate a new random maze.
{\em Clone} will copy a Displayed Project into your account (to be discussed in Paragraph \ref{cloning}). 
{\em Display} will submit your project for review. If you think that 
      other users would find your program or game interesting, this is the way to make it 
      available to them. Upon passing the review, your project will be added to Displayed Projects.

{\em Edit} menu allows you to operate with input and text cells (to be discussed in 
Section \ref{sec:editmenu}). In {\em Settings} you can change Karel's {\em Level} (to be discussed
in Paragraph \ref{levels}), change his speed, and adjust sound preferences. The blue arrow and square 
buttons are used to run and stop programs, and the two buttons next to them can be used to increase and decrease 
font size. The pair of icons on far right is the step counter (that can be reset by clicking on it) and 
gem counter that indicates how many gems Karel has in his bag.

\subsection{Cloning Displayed Projects} \label{cloning}

All programs and exercises that we will work with are
available for you to clone. To do this, 
click on the File Manager icon. In the File Manager's menu go to 
{\em Project} and then click on {\em Clone}. This will launch a new window 
with Displayed Projects as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cloning}.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/cloning.png}
\end{center}
%\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{File Manager's {\em Project} menu allows you to clone many Karel projects.}
\label{fig:cloning}
\end{figure}
\noindent
All projects whose names start with "Karel - Exercise" are of particular interest 
for this tutorial. Their solutions have names starting with "Karel - Solution". 
Any of them can be cloned into your account via clicking on the project name in the window, 
and pressing the button {\em Clone}.

In the File Manager's right-hand side panel, you will see the list of all 
projects that you cloned. Click on any of them to launch it. You are free to 
use the cloned projects as they are, or modify them in any way you like. Your 
modifications will not affect the original. And, you can 
always synchronize your version with the original, via 
a right-click on the project in the File Manager and selecting {\em Synchronize}.
Keep in mind though -- synchronizing with the original will erase any changes that 
you made to the project.

%\subsection{Basic and Full Versions}
%
%Users sponsored by an institution are using NCLab in Full Version. Some limitations 
%apply to users who use NCLab in Basic Version (see Terms of Use for details). These 
%users have an Upgrade icon on their Desktop, that they can use to upgrade 
%NCLab to Full Version for a symbolic monthly subscription fee.

\subsection{Karel modes} \label{levels}

Karel operates in four modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Manual mode:} The robot is controlled using the mouse and five buttons Go, Get, Left, Right, and Put. 
      Watch out and do not crash!
\item {\em Program mode:} The robot is controlled using written programs (computer code). The Program mode is 
      split into several Levels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Level 1 is a transition layer between the Manual and Programming modes. Programs are written using only 
      five commands {\tt go}, {\tt get}, {\tt left}, {\tt right}, and {\tt put} that exactly correspond to 
      the buttons Go, Get, Left, Right, and Put in Manual mode.
\item Level 2 is where the actual programming begins. On top of the commands from Level 1, programs can contain 
      conditions, loops, and custom commands.
\item Level 3 teaches the user to operate with logical and numerical variables, and with computer memory. Karel  
      also has receives a GPS device. This Level is in preparation.
\item Level 4 teaches the basics of object-oriented programming. This Level is in preparation.
\item Level 5 teaches the basics of parallel programming. This Level is in preparation.
\end{itemize}
\item {\em Build mode:} This mode allows the user to create custom mazes.
\item {\em Game mode:} Makes it possible to create and play games. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What can you do with a displayed Karel project that you clone into your account?.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] View but not run.
\item[A2] View and run but not edit.
\item[A3] View, run and edit but not save.
\item[A4] View, run, edit, save, whatever, they are all yours!
\end{enumerate}
\item What are the four modes of the Karel application?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] Manual mode, Build mode, Program mode, Game mode.
\item[A2] Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3, Mode 4.
\item[A3] Beginner mode, Intermediate mode, Advanced mode, Expert mode.
\item[A4] Karel has no modes.
\end{enumerate}
\item What is the difference between Levels 1 and 2?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] In Level 2 the robot has more sensors. 
\item[A2] In Level 2 one can only guide the robot with the mouse.
\item[A3] In Level 2 one can only use 5 commands.
\item[A4] In Level 2 programs can contain 
      conditions, loops, and custom commands.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Section A - Operating the Robot in Manual Mode}

\subsection{Objectives} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to operate the robot in Manual mode.
\end{itemize}
When launching Karel through the Programming icon, switch to Manual mode using the corresponding 
menu button. Then, five buttons Left, Right, Go, Get and Put will appear in the panel on the left.
Their functions are self-explanatory. When you first clone a Karel Exercise ("A" section contains 
games in manual mode) and then 
run it, there is not even need to switch to Manual mode -- just press the Start button and you are 
all set (Game mode is enabled in Full Version only).

\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How can Karel be switched to Manual mode?
\begin{enumerate}

\section{Section B - Bridge to Programming}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
In Programming mode, we type commands into an input cell located in the left panel.
The robot obeys written commands {\tt left}, {\tt right}, {\tt go}, {\tt get}, and {\tt put}.
These commands have exactly the same function as the corresponding buttons in Manual mode.

\section{Intermission - Algorithms, Programs, and Bugs}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the difference between {\em algorithm} and {\em program}. 
\item Learn the difference between {\em syntactical} and {\em logical} mistakes.
\item Understand that {\em debugging} is an indivisible part of computer programming.
\end{itemize}
Karel always obeys all commands {\em precisely}. Sometimes it may happen that 
we plan one thing but to our surprise the robot does something else. In most cases this 
happens when our {\em algorithm} is wrong. By an {\em algorithm} we mean a sequence of 
logical steps that the robot needs to follow in order to fulfill his task. Algorithms 
are presented using normal human language, not in terms of the robot's commands. 

{\em Program} or {\em computer code} is created when the algorithm is expressed
in terms of the robot's language. When our algorithm is good, then 
the program is easy to write.

Mistakes in algorithms are called {\em logical errors}. A logical error is, for 
example, when we crash the robot into a wall because we forgot to make a turn.
Mistakes such as mis-spelling a command, writing "1o" instead of "10", or forgetting 
indentation are related to 
{\em syntax} and they are called {\em syntactical errors}. Of these two types, 
logical errors are usually much more difficult to find. 

In general, mistakes or either kind are called {\em bugs} and the procedure of 
eliminating them is called {\em debugging}. Depending on how careful we 
were while preparing our algorithm and writing the program, debugging takes either 
a short time or a long time. It does not happen often that a program works correctly
right away. 

When we commit a syntactical error,
the robot will write an error message and do nothing.
If our algorithm contains a logical error, then he will
write an error message and stop executing the program. 
The most usual logical error are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Karel crashes into a wall.
\item The robot tries to collect a gem where is none.
\item He attempts to put a gem on the ground while his bag is empty.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Section C - Counting Loop}

\subsection{Objectives} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to make the robot repeat something a given number of times.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In Section B we successfully crossed the bridge between manual control 
and programming. The bridge collapsed, there is no way back. But do 
not worry about that! The land of Programming is much more beautiful,
and once you understand its beauty, you will never want to leave.


\subsection{The {\tt repeat} command}

The {\em counting loop}, represented by the {\tt repeat} command, can save 
us lots of writing when something is repeated a given number of times. 
For example, for Karel to make 15 steps forward we could type:

\begin{verbatim}
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
go
\end{verbatim}
But this is neither efficient nor elegant. Instead, the same can be
achieved by telling Karel to {\tt repeat} the {\tt go} command {\tt 7} times:

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 15
  go
\end{verbatim}
There are a few simple rules that we need to remember when using the {\tt repeat} command:

\begin{itemize}
\item Keep code readable -- always write one command per line.
\item Indentation -- all commands to be repeated (the {\em body of the loop}) need to be indented. You can
      choose whether you prefer 2-indents or 4-indents. The former yields more compact 
      code with not-so-long lines, the latter is easier to read. 
\item Cancel the indentation for the first command that does not belong to the body of the loop.
\end{itemize}
To illustrate what the indentation does, let's look at a code that will move the robot 8 steps forward:

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 4
  go
  go
\end{verbatim}
Compare to a code that will only move the robot 5 steps forward:

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 4
  go
go
\end{verbatim}
Multiple {\tt repeat} commands can be {\em nested}. This means that a {\tt repeat} command 
can used in the body of another {\tt repeat} command. Everything that was said about indentation 
still holds. Can you figure out what the following code does?

\begin{verbatim}
repeat 10
  repeat 5
    go
  repeat 2
    left
\end{verbatim}
After you figure it out, launch Karel via the {\em Programming} menu, enter this code into
the input cell, and run it! But before you do, remember to switch to {\em Build mode} and make 
some free space in front of the robot 
so that he does not crash into a wall.

\subsection{Review questions} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item What command should we use to make the robot repeat something a given number of times?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] {\tt repetition}
\item[A2] {\tt loop}
\item[A3] {\tt for}
\item[A4] {\tt repeat}
\end{enumerate}
\item Why should we always write one command per line?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] To keep the code readable.
\item[A2] To make the code look longer.
\item[A3] Because all programming languages require that.
\item[A4] Because it speeds up communication with server.
\end{enumerate}
\item What is the {\em body of a loop}?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] Body of a loop is the number that follows the {\tt repeat} command. 
\item[A2] The command on the first line following the {\tt repeat} command.
\item[A3] One or more commands that follow the {\tt repeat} command and are indented.
\item[A4] One or more commands that follow the {\tt repeat} command and are not indented.
\end{enumerate}
\item Why does the body of a loop need to be indented?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] To make clear where the body of the loop begins and where it ends.
\item[A2] It does not have to be indented, the indentation is optional.
\item[A3] Because the code is visually nicer.
\item[A4] Because the code is easier to read.
\end{enumerate}
\item Which of the following programs will rotate Karel 360 degrees?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1]

\section{Intermission - Working with Input and Text Cells} \label{sec:editmenu}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn how to add descriptive text cells.
\item Learn when it makes sense to have multiple input cells and how to add them.
\item Learn how to run all input cells at once, and how to run them individually.
\item Learn how to clear, collapse, remove and merge cells.
\end{itemize}
It is a very good habit to add comments to programs (every line starting with the '{\tt \#}'
symbol is a comment) and also to include descriptive 
texts in Karel worksheets, since descriptions make it easier for someone else to 
understand your program. Sometimes you may be in the position of the "someone else" yourself,
when you return to your own program some time after you wrote it. Here are a couple of 
simple new rules to remember:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item New text cell can be added above or under the current cell via the option 
      {\em Add new text cell} in the Edit menu. 
      After an empty text cell appears, click into it and add text. The text can be 
      formatted using Restructured Text Format (RST). After your text is finished, click 
      on {\em save} under the text cell. 
\item The most commonly used formatting operations in RST are 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Making some text bold face. For this, put a double asterisk '{\tt **}' on either 
      side of the text. For example, type {\tt **This is bold face**} in RST.
      \item Headings are obtained by undelining some text with the '{\tt =}' symbols.
      An example of a heading is:
\begin{verbatim}
This is a Heading
=================
\end{verbatim}
      \item The RST format is very popular and so it is easy to Google more information
      if needed.
      \end{itemize}
\item New input cell can be added by clicking on {\em add} (located under each input cell). 
      Having multiple input cells can be useful, for example, to test various versions 
      of your program, or if you want to run parts of your program separately. 
\item Clicking on {\em clear} under an input cell will erase its contents.
\item Any cell can be collapsed by clicking on the bracket located on its right side. Collapsed
      cells can be expanded by clicking on the blue button that appears when a cell is 
      collapsed.
\item Clicking on {\em remove} under an input cell will remove it. All text in that cell will be lost.
\item Run programs via the blue arrow button in the menu (this will evaluate all input
      cells). Each cell can be evaluated individually by clicking on {\em run} (located under 
      each input cell). If there is just one input cell, both options are equivalent.
\item Running programs can be stopped using the blue square button in the menu. 
\item If a particular
      input cell needs to be stopped, then use the {\em stop} button under that cell.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Section D - Conditions}

\subsection{Objectives} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the function of Karel's five sensors.
\item Learn to use the sensors in conjunction with {\em conditions} to help Karel 
      check his surroundings and react accordingly. For example, you will learn to first 
      check whether wall is ahead before making a step forward, checking whether there
      is a gem on the ground before attempting to pick it up, etc.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Karel has built-in sensors to better navigate in the maze:

\subsection{Karel's five sensors}

\noindent
\underline{{\tt wall} sensor}

The first one is an infrared sensor {\tt wall} that the robot uses to determine 
whether it is safe to make one step forward, or whether there is a wall. This is 
illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:dede-ifelse}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/salih-ifelse.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-4mm}
\caption{Illustration of the {\tt wall} sensor.}
\label{fig:dede-ifelse}
%\vspace{-10mm}
\end{figure}
\noindent
The usage of the {\tt wall} sensor in a program can be illustrated using a simple program "Careful step" 
where Karel first checks whether there is a wall ahead before
making a step. If there is wall, he turns back: 

\begin{verbatim}
# Program "Careful step".
if wall
  repeat 2
    left
else
  go
\end{verbatim}
As we mentioned before, the symbol '{\tt \#}' introduces a comment, meaning that the line 
of code behind it is ignored by the robot.
The {\tt else} branch does not have to be there if it is not needed. Notice the indentation 
of the bodies of the {\tt if} and {\tt else} branches - this is analogous 
to how we indent the body of the {\tt repeat} command.\\

\noindent
\underline{{\tt gem} sensor}

This sensor returns true if the robot stands on a gem, false otherwise. \\

\noindent
\underline{{\tt empty} sensor}

This sensor returns true if the robot's bag with gems is empty, false otherwise. \\

\noindent
\underline{{\tt north} sensor}

This sensor returns true if the robot is facing North, false otherwise.\\

\noindent
\underline{{\tt home} sensor}

This sensor returns true if the robot is at home, false otherwise.\\

\noindent
\underline{Testing opposites}

Karel can also use the reserved word {\tt not} to test the opposites.
For illustration, the previous program can be rewritten as follows, without changing its function:
\begin{verbatim}
# Program "Careful step".
if not wall
  go
else
  repeat 2
    left
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Programming hints}

Good programmer is a careful programmer! Errors can be avoided by always checking the 
appropriate sensor before making an action. A few examples of careful actions:
 
\begin{verbatim}
if not wall
  go
\end{verbatim}
Another example:
 
\begin{verbatim}
if gem
  get
\end{verbatim}
And a last one:
 
\begin{verbatim}
if not empty
  put
\end{verbatim}

\section{Section E - Conditional Loop}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to repeat a command or a sequence of commands when it is not known 
      how many repetitions will be needed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The {\tt while} command}

Often Karel needs to repeat something, {\em not knowing in advance how many repetitions
there will be}. So, the {\tt repeat} command is not practical. This can be the case, for example, 
when the robot is asked to walk straight ahead until he reaches the closest wall.
Remember that he only can see walls that are right ahead of him -- walls 
that are further away he can't see. Such a program would be:

\begin{verbatim}
while not wall
  go
\end{verbatim}
Or, Karel may be asked to walk until he gets home:

\begin{verbatim}
while not home
  go
\end{verbatim}
Beware though -- {\bf this program is dangerous} since the robot will crash into a wall
if his home is not straight ahead of him!

Another example: The robot may be asked to empty his bag (he does not know how many gems are in it): 
 
\begin{verbatim}
while not empty
  put
\end{verbatim}
Or, he may be asked to collect all gems from a pile (he does not know 
how many gems there are):

\begin{verbatim}
while gem
  get
\end{verbatim}
Or we may ask him to turn to face North (he does not know which direction he is
facing):

\begin{verbatim}
while not north
  left
\end{verbatim}
At last, let us face the following situation: Karel is asked to 
turn South, walk straight ahead until he reaches the closest wall, and 
collect all gems that he can find on the way:

\begin{verbatim}
# First turn North.
while not north
  left

# Then turn South.
repeat 2
  left

# Go straight ahead and pick all gems.
while not wall
  if gem
    get
  go

# Pick gem at the wall (if any).
if gem
  get
\end{verbatim}
Notice that we first need to turn the robot to face North -- this is because North 
is the only direction that he can check!

\subsection{Review questions}

\section{Section F - Defining New Commands}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn that replicating computer code is a very bad habit.
\item Learn that splitting the big task into smaller ones will simplify the solution a lot. 
\item Learn to bring more structure and clarity into your programs by introducing new commands.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Programming hints}

{\em Always look for small tasks that can be solved independently of the big ones.
Solve the small tasks first, and you'll see that the big ones get much simpler. The 
importance of what we just said cannot be stressed more. Please read these three 
lines once more.}

\newpage
\noindent
The fact that you are reading this line of text proves that you are not 
a perfect programmer yet. Otherwise you would be stuck forever in the 
previous three lines that form an infinite loop!

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/smiley.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Never replicate code in a program!}

A new command should be defined whenever it becomes clear that the same 
action is repeated in the algorithm multiple times (yes, we talk about the algorithm,
not about the program). If you start writing a program and then realize that the same
code repeats itself at various places, then probably you did not do a good job 
designing the algorithm.

Sometimes it might be 
tempting to just replicate the same code several times in the 
program, because it does the same thing, but do not do it! This would be very bad programming
and sooner or later your own code would punish you for that. 
You would make a small change at one place but forget to do it 
in all the other places. Then your code would start 
acting strange, it would sometimes work and sometimes fail. 
You would spend lots of time looking for the mistakes, find some 
of them but not all, and your program would become unreliable
and after some time irreparable. You would find that you need to 
rewrite it from scratch.

\subsection{Defining new commands}

New commands are defined using the reserved word 
{\tt def}. For example, in a program where the robot needs to turn back
many times, it is a good idea to define a new command {\tt back}
as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
def back
  repeat 2
    left
\end{verbatim}
Note the indent -- the body of a new command needs to be indented 
analogously to the bodies of loops and conditions.

\subsection{Revisiting exercise A07}

Let us return to the exercise A07 - Right Button for a moment.
A really bad program to solve this task would be:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
right
go
go
go
go 
get
right
go
go
go
go 
get
right
go
go
go
go
get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Can you see how many times the same code is repeated?! In order to fix this, 
we should define new command {\tt foursteps} as
follows:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def foursteps
  repeat 4
    go
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
With this new command, the above code simplifies to 

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
right
foursteps
get
right
foursteps
get
right
foursteps
get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
There are still repetitions that must be eliminated! So we define a new command 
{\tt walkedge}:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def walkedge
  right
  foursteps
  get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Now with the new commands {\tt foursteps} and
{\tt walkedge}, our program simplifies to:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
while not home
  walkedge
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
It is the task of the first exercise in this Section to implement this program. But before we 
do so, let us mention one very important thing.

\subsection{Solution procedure revisited (and corrected)}

Let's forget the commands that we defined above.
Experienced programmer would never approach the problem the way we did.
He (or she but let's use "he" for simplicity) 
would first look at the problem, trying to recognize repeating patterns. 
He would find that the task can be fulfilled by repeating one simpler task 
three times. So, without knowing exactly how the smaller task is going to 
be solved, he would write:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
while not home
  walkedge
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Next he would define the new command {\tt walkedge} as follows:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def walkedge
  right
  foursteps
  get
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
He would not bother defining the command 
{\tt foursteps} yet, because he knows that this will be 
simple. And as the last step, to make the program work, he would 
define:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
def foursteps
  repeat 4
    go
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Should we, or should we not always try to split a big task into smaller ones?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] No, because the resulting program would be too long.
\item[A2] Yes, because then we can only solve those ones that we like.
\item[A3] Yes, because then we can ask friends to solve some of them for us.
\item[A4] Yes, because the big task becomes simpler to solve.
\end{enumerate}
\item Should we, or should we not replicate computer code?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] Yes, because the resulting program is faster.
\item[A2] Yes, because we do not have to think about new commands.
\item[A3] No, because our code would become prone to errors.
\item[A4] No, because the Karel language does not allow that.
\end{enumerate}
\item When should a new command be defined?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] Whenever the same command is repeated on two consecutive lines in the code.
\item[A2] Whenever the algorithm contains an action that is repeated multiple times
          (a small task inside a big one).
\item[A3] Whenever the code contains an {\tt if - else} statement.
\item[A4] If the code is longer than 100 lines.

\section{Section G - Logical Variables}

\subsection{Objectives} 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to work with elementary and more complex logical expressions.
\item Learn to define and use logical variables.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In programming, variables are used to store information for later use. This information can 
be a number, word, sentence, or simply a {\em True} or {\em False}. We will start
with the last type. 

\subsection{Logical expressions}
Logical expressions are expressions that can be answered with either {\em True} or 
{\em False}. We say that the {\em True} or the {\em False} is their value. Here are some 
real-life examples, try to answer them with {\em True} or {\em False}:

\begin{itemize}
\item "I am 15 years old."
\item "My dad is a teacher."
\item "My school's name is Coral Academy."
\end{itemize}
And here are some Karel examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item wall ({\em True} if the robot is facing a wall, {\em False} otherwise)
\item home ({\em True} if the robot is home, {\em False} otherwise)
\item gem ({\em True} if the robot stands on a gem, {\em False} otherwise)
\item north ({\em True} if the robot is facing North, {\em False} otherwise)
\item empty ({\em True} if the robot does not have any gems on him, {\em False} otherwise)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical variables}

In programming as well as in real life we often deal with logical expressions that are 
fairly complex. Often we use two or more simple logical expressions in one sentence, 
and moreover combine them with logical operations {\em and}, {\em or} or {\em not}.

For example, the sentence "I will go skiing on Saturday if weather is good and if 
Michael goes as well." includes three simple logical expressions. Let's call 
them for brevity\\

\noindent
A = "I will go skiing on Saturday."\\
B = "The weather is good."\\
C = "Michael goes as well."\\

\noindent
There is a logical operation {\em and} between the expressions B and C.

The original sentence can be written briefly as "if (B and C) then A". We love this kind of 
brevity in programming! A, B and C are {\em logical variables}. Logical variables 
can only represent {\em True} or {\em False}, and their purpose is to ease the operation with 
longer expressions.
Regarding the original sentence, we could go one step further and define a new logical variable\\

\noindent
D = B {\em and} C.\\

\noindent
Then, the sentence would become just "if D then A"! 

\subsection{Logical operations}

It is worth mentioning the following properties of the logical operation {\em and}:\\

\begin{center}
\framebox{(A {\em and} B) is {\em True} only if both A and B are {\em True}. Otherwise A {\em and} B is {\em False}.}
\end{center}
\vspace{4mm}
\noindent
The logical operation {\em or} has the following properties:\\

\begin{center}
\framebox{(A {\em or} B) is {\em True} if at least one of A, B is {\em True}. If both A. B are {\em False}, (A {\em or} B) is {\em False}.}
\end{center}
\vspace{4mm}
\noindent
We also use the logical operation {\em not} with the following property:\\

\begin{center}
\framebox{({\em not} A) is {\em True} if A is {\em False} and vice versa.}
\end{center}


\subsection{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are {\em variables} used for in programming? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] To generate random data.
\item[A2] To make programs shorter.
\item[A3] To store information for later use.
\item[A4] To create variable mazes.
\end{enumerate}
\item What is a {\em logical expression}? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] Expression that makes sense.
\item[A2] Expression that is always true. 
\item[A3] Expression that is either true or false.
\item[A4] Expression that cannot be false.
\end{enumerate}
\item A is {\em True} and B is {\em False}. What is then the value of (A {\em and} {\em not} (A {\em or} B)) ?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] {\em False}.
\item[A2] {\em True}.
\item[A3] It can be both {\em True} and {\em False}.
\item[A4] Neither {\em True} nor {\em False}.
\end{enumerate}
\item A is {\em True} and B is {\em True}. What is then the value of (A {\em and} {\em not} (A {\em and} {\em not} B)) ?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A1] {\em False}.
\item[A2] {\em True}.
\item[A3] It can be both {\em True} and {\em False}.
\item[A4] Neither {\em True} nor {\em False}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise G01 - Numerology I}

{\em Each 3x5 box contains an integer number between 0 and 9. The numbers are not known to Karel a-priori. He needs to enter each box and recognize the number in it. Let's call this number N. When he leaves the box, he needs to create a pile of N gems. The task finishes when this is done for all boxes and the robot gets home.}

\subsection{Exercise G04 - Eight Queens}

{\em Karel stands on an 8 x 8 chess board along with eight queens (the gems). Recall that a chess queen dominates its row, its column, as well as both diagonals that pass through her position. Nothing may stand in these fields or she will destroy it. Currently, some queens are threatening each other. Write a program for Karel to correct the positions of the queens in such a way that none of them is threatened. Your program should be able to do it for any initial distribution of the queens. Enter the home after you are finished.}

\subsection{Exercise G05 - BubbleSort}

{\em Karel stands in front of four piles of gems, let's enumerate them by 1, 2, 3 and 4. He does not know how many gems are in each pile. All he knows is that each pile contains between 1 and 4 gems, and that two or more piles can be equally large. Sort the piles in such a way that the smallest pile is on the left and the largest on the right. Use the BubbleSort algorithm: Implement a function that switches two adjacent piles if the one on the right has fewer gems than the one on the left. Apply this function to piles 1 and 2, then to piles 2 and 3, then to piles 3 and 4. Now it is certain that the largest number is on the right-most position! Next, do the same for just the first three piles. Last, apply the function to piles 1 and 2, and you are done! }

\section{What Next?}

Congratulations on making it to the end of the tutorial! We hope that you
enjoyed it. If you can think of any ways to improve the application 
Karel the Robot in NCLab or this tutorial, please let us know. If you 
have an interesting game for Karel, please let us know as well. 

Although you may feel like an Almighty Programmer right now, we would
recommend staying humble. Even the most experienced programmers are
learning new things all the time. If you enjoy programming, your next 
language to learn may be Python. We have a Python Programming tutorial
in NCLab for you. We would also recommend that you learn Javascript since this 
is the most popular language for web development. Depending on your 
other hobbies or interests, C++ or even Fortran might be interesting. 
In any case, the NCLab Team wishes you good luck, and keep us in your 
favorite bookmarks!\\
