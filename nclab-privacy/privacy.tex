\subsection*{General Information}

The Networked Computing Laboratory (NCLab) is owned and operated by FEMhub Inc. ("Provider", "We").\\

\noindent
The email address that you enter during account creation is stored in our database for the sole purpose of password retrieval if you forget your password. We do not disclose it to any third party, and do not use it to send you advertisements. \\

\noindent
We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:\\

\noindent
It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if Provider is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Provider will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\

\noindent
We use cookies to record current session information, but do not use permanent cookies. You are required to re-login to your NCLab account after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.\\


\noindent
{\bf Data Storage}: Provider uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary 
hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run NCLab. Although 
Provider owns the code, databases, and all rights to the NCLab application, you retain all rights 
to your private data and private projects. In Terms of Use, you expressly agree to let others copy, modify,
and re-share your public projects.\\


\noindent

changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address 
specified in your NCLab primary account holder account or by placing a prominent notice on our 
site. Such notice will be given at least 3 days in advance of the date the new policy will be 
applied.\\
