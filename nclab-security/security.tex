\vspace{6mm}
\noindent
All user data in NCLab is stored in a MongoDB distributed database system. No user data is stored on computing nodes. When you launch a computation, a computational engine is created on the corresponding cloud instance, and your data is transferred there via an EV SLL secured connection. After the computation finished, your data is transferred back the same way, the engine is terminated, your temporary data is deleted, and eventually the cloud instance is destroyed. 


\subsection*{Physical Security}

Biometric scanning is employed for controlled data center access. Multiple security cameras are used to monitor all data center locations. 24x7 onsite staff provides additional protection against unauthorized entry.


\subsection*{System Security}

System installation is done using hardened, patched OS. Dedicated firewall and VPN services are used to help block unauthorized system access. Dedicated intrusion detection devices to provide an additional layer of protection against unauthorized system access.


\subsection*{Operational Security}


Systems access is logged and tracked for auditing purposes. Secure document-destruction policies are in place for all sensitive information.

\subsection*{Communications}

All private data exchanged with us is always transmitted over EV SSL
The login credentials used to access NCLab can not be used to access a shell or the file system. All users are virtual (meaning they have no user account on our machines) and are access controlled.


\subsection*{Backups of Database}

All user data is stored in a MongoDB distributed database system. Backup of the database is performed every 8 hours, and copies are stored both internally at FEMhub Inc. and at two undisclosed external cloud service providers. 


\subsection*{Employee Access}

No Provider’s employees ever access users’ data in the database unless required to for support reasons. Support staff may log into your account to access settings related to your support issue. When working a support issue we do our best to respect your privacy as much as possible, we only access the files and settings needed to resolve your issue.


\subsection*{Maintaining Security}

We protect your login from brute force attacks with rate limiting. All passwords are filtered from all our logs and encrypted. Login information is always sent over SSL.
We keep a security consultant on retainer to help identify and prevent new attack vectors. We always test new features in order to cut out potential attacks, such as XSS-protecting wikis, and ensuring that Pages cannot access cookies.


\subsection*{Credit Card Safety}

When you sign up for a paid Service, we do not store any of your card information on our servers. It is handed off to PayPal.
