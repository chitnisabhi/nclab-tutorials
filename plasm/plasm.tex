\section{What is PLaSM?}

PLaSM ({\em Programming Language for Solid Modeling}) is a design language
that enables geometrical modeling of 3D objects via simple commands.
The language was developed by the CAD Group at the Universities of Roma 
"La Sapienza" and "Roma Tre" in Italy. It is based on FL, an advanced 
language for functional programming developed by the Functional 
Programming Group at the IBM Research Center.\\

\noindent
PLaSM makes it possible to define a wide range of simple 3D objects, transform 
them, create intersections and unions via simple logical operations, and much 
more. This tutorial will guide you in small steps and using many examples
through PLaSM's usage. Soon, you will be able to create advanced 
3D geometries such as the one shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pisa}.

\label{fig:pisa}
\end{figure}

\section{Getting Started}

In order to make the most of this tutorial, we invite the 
reader to create an account in NCLab and log in. More instructions 
on how to do this are given at the beginning of the introductory 
tutorial "Meet Your New Graphing Calculator" that is available in 
PDF via a link on NCLab home page {\tt http://nclab.com}. \\

\noindent
{\bf NOTE: It is required that your web browser supports WebGL.} Link to 
a WebGL tester is provided on NCLab's front page.\\

\noindent
After logging in, you will see a PC-like desktop with several icons on it,
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:desktop}. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/desktop.png}
\end{center}
%\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{NCLab desktop after login.}
\label{fig:desktop}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Begin by clicking on the File Manager icon. This will launch the File Manager.
In the Project menu choose New $\rightarrow$ Python. This will launch an 
empty Python project, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:python}.

\caption{Launching a new Python project.}
\label{fig:python}
\end{figure}
\noindent

\noindent
In the input cell, enter the code:

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
cube = CUBOID([1, 1, 1])
VIEW(cube, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
Then click on the link "run" under the input cell. This will send a request 
to the cloud. The answer should come back instantly, and a new WebGL widget 
with a unit cube in it should appear, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cube}. 
Congratulations, you just created your first PLaSM model!
