\section{What is PLaSM?}

PLaSM ({\em Programming Language for Solid Modeling}) is a design language
that enables geometrical modeling of 3D objects via simple commands.
The language was developed by the CAD Group at the Universities of Roma 
"La Sapienza" and "Roma Tre" in Italy. It is based on FL, an advanced 
language for functional programming developed by the Functional 
Programming Group at the IBM Research Center.\\

\noindent
PLaSM makes it possible to define a wide range of simple 3D objects, transform 
them, create intersections and unions via simple logical operations, and much 
more. This tutorial will guide you in small steps and using many examples
through PLaSM's usage. Soon, you will be able to create advanced 
3D geometries such as the one shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pisa}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/pisa.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Snapshot of a PLaSM model of the famous Pisa Tower.}
\label{fig:pisa}
\end{figure}

\section{Getting Started}

In order to make the most of this tutorial, we invite the 
reader to create an account in NCLab and log in. More instructions 
on how to do this are given at the beginning of the introductory 
tutorial "Meet Your New Graphing Calculator" that is available in 
PDF via a link on NCLab home page {\tt http://nclab.com}. \\

\noindent
{\bf NOTE}: Your web browser needs to support WebGL, otherwise you will not be able to 
work with PLaSM properly. For this reason, a WebGL tester is provided 
on NCLab's front page.\\

\noindent
After logging in, you will see a PC-like desktop with several icons on it,
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:desktop}. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/desktop.png}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Launching a new Python project}

Click on the File Manager icon. This will launch the File Manager.
In the Project menu choose New $\rightarrow$ Python. This will launch an 
empty Python project, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:python}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\subsection{Creating a unit cube}

In the input cell, enter the code:

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
cube = CUBOID([1, 1, 1])
lab.view(cube, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
Then click on the link "run" under the input cell. This will send a request 
to the cloud. The answer should come back instantly, and a new WebGL widget 
with a unit cube in it should appear, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cube}. 
Congratulations, you just created your first PLaSM model!

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/cube.png}
\end{center}
%\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{WebGL widget containing a unit cube.}
\label{fig:cube}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mouse controls}

Now click into the window and move the mouse while holding the left
button pressed. The cube should freely rotate in 3D. Holding the middle
button (or the mouse wheel) pressed and moving the mouse will move the 
object to any direction. Zooming can be done with the mouse wheel or
with the right-hand mouse button.

\section{Creating Simple Objects}

Before we move on, let us briefly explain the above code.
The first line, 

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
\end{verbatim}
imports the PLaSM library into NCLab. This is similar to how we imported
the Sympy, Numpy and Scipy libraries in the introductory course "Meet Your 
New Graphing Calculator". The second line,

\begin{verbatim}
cube = CUBOID([1, 1, 1])
\end{verbatim}
defines a 3D unit cube. The CUBOID command will be explained in more detail below.
The last line,

\begin{verbatim}
lab.view(cube, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
tells NCLab to display the cube in a WebGL widget. 

\subsection{Using colors}

The triplet {\tt [0.4, 0.9, 0.6]} in the {\tt lab.view()} command
represents the RGB components defining a color. The numbers need to be between 
0.0 and 1.0. You can experiment with colors, keeping a few simple rules in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\item With just the first value being non-zero, such as in {\tt [0.5, 0, 0]},
      you get {\bf red} color. The closer the value is to 1.0, the lighter the color
      will be.
\item With just the second value being non-zero, such as in {\tt [0, 0.5, 0]},
      you obtain {\bf green} color. The closer the  value is to 1.0, the lighter the color
      will be.
\item With just the third value being non-zero, such as in {\tt [0, 0, 0.5]},
      you will have {\bf blue} color. The closer the  value is to 1.0, the lighter the color
      will be.
\item Using three identical values will result into a shade of grey. {\tt [0, 0, 0]}
      means black, {\tt [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]} means white.
\item Varying all three numbers, you can get any color that you want. It is not 
      easy to translate a color, such as "purple", "cyan" or "orange" into the RGB
      values. But there are many web pages that will do it for you, such as for
      example http://kb.iu.edu/data/aetf.html. {\bf Note}: Usually,
      the RGB values on these web pages are given as integers between 0 and 255. To use them in NCLab,
      just divide all three of them by 255.
\end{itemize}

 
\subsection{Brick, cube, rectangle, and square -- command CUBOID}

Why is the command called 
CUBOID and not CUBE? The answer is -- because the command covers more 
than cubes. With three parameters {\tt [a, b, c]} it will render 
a 3D brick with edge lengths {\tt a}, {\tt b} and {\tt c}. Let us change the 
above code to  

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
cube = CUBOID([3, 2, 1])
lab.view(cube, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
and press the "run" link under the input cell again. The result is 
displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:cuboid-1}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/cuboid-1.png}

\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{CUBOID([3, 2, 1]) generates a brick with edge lenghts 3, 2 and 1.}
\label{fig:cuboid-1}
\end{figure}
\noindent
With two parameters {\tt [a, b]} the CUBOID command will render a 2D rectangle 
(2D brick if you like) with edge lengths {\tt a} and {\tt b}, as shown in 
Fig. \ref{fig:cuboid-2}

\newpage


\subsection{Unit tetrahedron and triangle -- command SIMPLEX}

A unit tetrahedron (unit 3D simplex) can be created using the code
\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
tet = SIMPLEX(3)
lab.view(tet, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The output of the above code is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:simplex-1}.

\includegraphics[width=0.82\textwidth]{img/simplex-1.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{SIMPLEX(3) generates a unit 3D simplex (unit tetrahedron).}
\label{fig:simplex-1}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Note -- in the next paragraph we will show how to create a general 
tetrahedron using the 
A unit triangle (unit 2D simplex) can be created using the code
\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
tria = SIMPLEX(2)
lab.view(tria, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The output of the above code is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:simplex-2}.
\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{SIMPLEX(2) generates a unit 2D simplex (triangle).}
\label{fig:simplex-2}
\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{General tetrahedron and triangle}

The command CONVEXHULL is a powerful tool to define convex 3D and 2D objects using 
their corner points. In particular it can be used to create general tetrahedra and 
triangles. The command takes a list of points as an argument. For example, the code

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
points = [[-1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 4, 1], [0, 1, 5]]
tetra = CONVEXHULL(points)
lab.view(tetra, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
creates a tetrahedron with vertices $[-1, 0, 0]$, $[1, 0, 0]$, $[0, 4, 1]$ and $[0, 1, 5]$.
The code

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
points = [[1, 1], [4, 2], [2, 4]]
tria = CONVEXHULL(points)
lab.view(tria, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
generates a triangle with the vertices $[1, 1]$, $[4, 2]$ and $[2, 4]$. In this way 
the reader can define any convex polytop in 3D or polygon in 2D -- just using more 
points!

\subsection{Command CONVEXHULL}

Let us demonstrate the true power of PLaSM by writing a simple program that generates 
a polygon with $N$ equally-long edges that is inscribed into a circle of radius $R$.
For this example, you need to know elementary commands of the Python programming 
language. If you have never programmed in Python, do not worry and skip to the next 
example. Eventually, read the tutorial on Python Programming that is also provided
in NCLab.

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
from numpy import sin, cos, pi
N = 15
R = 5
points = []
for i in range(N):
    angle = i * 2. * pi / N
    points.append([R * cos(angle), R * sin(angle)])
polygon = CONVEXHULL(points)
lab.view(polygon, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The output of the above code is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:convexhull-1}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.82\textwidth]{img/convexhull-1.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Polygon with 15 equally long edges inscribed into a circle.}
\label{fig:convexhull-1}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Circle via convex hull}

When the parameter $N$ is increased to 128 or 256 in the last program, 
one obtains a {\bf circle}. This is in fact the way circles are handled in PLaSM.
 

\subsection{Cone via convex hull}

The CONVEXHULL command has amazing power. Let us tweak the code
from the previous paragraph a bit to construct a cone of radius
$R$ and height $H$. All we need to do is to add a zero third coordinate 
to the points generated in the previous program, and add one more 
point -- the tip of the cone. The CONVEXHULL command will take care 
of the rest:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
from numpy import sin, cos, pi
R = 5
H = 10
points = []
subdiv = 128
for i in range(N):
    angle = i * 2. * pi / subdiv
    points.append([R * cos(angle), R * sin(angle), 0])
points.append([0, 0, H])
cone = CONVEXHULL(points)
lab.view(cone, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
The output of the above code is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:convexhull-2}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.82\textwidth]{img/convexhull-2.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Cone of radius $R$ and height $H$.}
\label{fig:convexhull-2}
\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}
\newpage
The subdivision {\tt subdic = 128} is how many
faces are used to approximate the round surface. You may use less, 
for example 64 or even 32, which will make the rendering faster, but
the surface will be less smooth. On the other hand, with more than 
128 subdivisions the surface will be even more smooth-looking, but 
the rendering will take longer.

\subsection{Command CYLINDER}

We have no doubt that the reader would be able to construct 
a cylinder of radius $R$ and height $H$ via convex hull. 
In fact, you may try it as a simple exercise, starting from 
the program for the cone. But, PLaSM has a specific command
CYLINDER for that:

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
R = 0.25
H = 1.0
cyl = CYLINDER ([R, H])(128)
lab.view(cyl, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The cylinder's axis is in the $z$-direction, and the midpoint of
its base circle is the origin (0, 0, 0). 
The output of the above code is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cyl-1}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/cyl-1.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Cylinder of radius $R$ and height $H$.}
\label{fig:cyl-1}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Command TUBE}

A hollow tube of inner radius $r$, outer radius $R$ and height
$H$ is rendered using the TUBE command. It is used as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
r = 0.9
R = 1.0
H = 3.0
tube = TUBE([r, R, H])(128)
lab.view(tube, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The tube's axis is in the $z$-direction, and the midpoint of
its base circle is the origin (0, 0, 0). Again, the parameter
128 is the number of linear faces that approximate the 
curved surfaces. The output of the above code is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tube-1}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/tube-1.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Tube of inner radius $r$, outer radius $R$ and height $H$.}
\label{fig:tube-1}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Command SPHERE}

A sphere of radius $R$ is rendered using the command SPHERE.
For example, the code

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
R = 1.0
s = SPHERE(3.0)([64, 64])
lab.view(s, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
will render a unit sphere whose origin is at (0, 0, 0). 
The parameter {\tt [64, 64]} stands for 
subdivision in both tangential directions. We need to be a bit 
careful with increasing this number, since doubling it to 
{\tt [128, 128]} would increase 
the number of linear faces approximation the sphere {\bf four times}.
The output of the above code is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sphere-1}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/sphere-1.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Sphere of radius $R$ and origin (0, 0, 0).}
\label{fig:sphere-1}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Torus -- command TORUS}

The TORUS command takes an inner radius $r$ and outer radius 
$R$ as parameters. It is used as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
r = 3.0
R = 5.0
tor = TORUS([r, R])([64, 64])
lab.view(tor, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The center of the torus is at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its axis
is the $z$-axis. This is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:torus-1}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.82\textwidth]{img/torus-1.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Sphere of radius $R$ and origin (0, 0, 0).}
\label{fig:torus-1}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Command STAR}

The STAR command will render a star with $N$ vertices. It is used as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
N = 5
s = STAR(N)
lab.view(s, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The center of the star is at (0, 0), it is inscribed into the unit circle,  
and it lies in the $xy$-plane. Soon we will learn how to enlarge it, rotate it,
and translate it. The
output of the above code is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:star-1}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/star-1.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Star with $N$ vertices inscribed into the unit circle.}
\label{fig:star-1}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Extrusion of 2D objects into 3D -- commands QUOTE and POWER}

Any 2D object can be easily extruded into 3D, by performing 
Cartesian product with a 1D interval in the third direction. This is done using the 
QUOTE and POWER commands. For example, the following code will
extrude the star that we created with the last program:

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
N = 5
H = 1.0
s = STAR(N)
s3d = POWER([s, QUOTE([H])])
lab.view(s3d, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The output is displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:star-2}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/star-2.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{3D star obtained from the original 2D star via the QUOTE and POWER commands.}
\label{fig:star-2}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}

\section{Transformations}

So far we have learned how to create a variety of simple 2D and 3D objects. 
The next step is to learn how to scale, rotate, and translate them. PLaSM
provides simple commands for that. Let us begin with scaling.

\subsection{Command SCALE}

The SCALE command takes three arguments: A list of axial directions in which 
the object will be scaled (as integers), list of scaling factors for these 
directions, and the object to be scaled. For example, let us create a cylinder 
{\tt cyl} of radius 1.0 and height 0.3:

\begin{verbatim}
from pyplasm import *
cyl = CYLINDER([1.0, 0.3])(128)
\end{verbatim}
We know from before that the axis of this cylinder coincides with the $z$-axis 
and that the center of its bottom face is at (0, 0, 0). The output is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:scale-0}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/scale-0.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Cylinder of radius 1.0 and height 0.3.}
\label{fig:scale-0}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}

\noindent
\underline{\em Scaling in $x$-direction}\\

The following command will 
scale the cylinder in the $x$-direction by the factor of 2.0: 

\begin{verbatim}
cyl1 = SCALE([1])([2.0])(cyl)
lab.view(cyl1, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The output is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:scale-1}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/scale-1.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Cylinder scaled in the first axial direction by 2.0.}
\label{fig:scale-1}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}

\noindent
\underline{\em Scaling in $y$-direction}\\

The following command will 
scale the cylinder in the $y$-direction by the factor of 2.0: 

\begin{verbatim}
cyl2 = SCALE([2])([2.0])(cyl)
lab.view(cyl2, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The output is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:scale-2}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/scale-2.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Cylinder scaled in the second axial direction by 2.0.}
\label{fig:scale-2}
%\vspace{-1cm}
\end{figure}

\noindent
\underline{\em Scaling in $z$-direction}\\

The following command will 
scale the cylinder in the $z$-direction by the factor of 2.0: 

\begin{verbatim}
cyl3 = SCALE([3])([2.0])(cyl)
lab.view(cyl3, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The output is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:scale-3}.

\underline{\em Scaling in $x$ and $z$ directions simultaneously}\\

The following command will 
scale the cylinder simultaneously in the $x$- directions by 2.0 and in the $z$-direction by 4.0.
This can be viewed as scaling in the $xz$-plane:

\begin{verbatim}
cyl4 = SCALE([1, 3])([2.0, 4.0])(cyl)
lab.view(cyl4, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The output is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:scale-4}.

\noindent
Similarly, we could scale the object in the $xy$-plane using 

\begin{verbatim}
cyl4 = SCALE([1, 2])([2.0, 4.0])(cyl)
lab.view(cyl4, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
or in the $yz$-plane using 

\begin{verbatim}
cyl4 = SCALE([2, 3])([2.0, 4.0])(cyl)
lab.view(cyl4, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
\underline{\em Scaling in all exial directions simultaneously}\\

The following command will 
scale the cylinder simultaneously in all three axial directions by the factors
2.0, 0.5 and 4.0.

\begin{verbatim}
cyl5 = SCALE([1, 2, 3])([2.0, 0.5, 4.0])(cyl)
lab.view(cyl5, [0.4, 0.9, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}
The output is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:scale-5}.
