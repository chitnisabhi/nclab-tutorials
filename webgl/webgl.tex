\section{WebGL}

WebGL is one of the most amazing recent features of web browsers, but at the same time also one of the most 
problematic ones. 

\subsection*{What If It Does Not Work?}

WebGL is only needed for work with advanced 3D geometries such as CAD models in PLaSM. Everything else 
works just fine without WebGL. NCLab will function correctly in your web browser if it does not 
support WebGL.

\subsection*{How Does It Work?}

WebGL is a web browser analogy of OpenGL 
(hardware-accelerated 3D graphics) that provides amazing 3D visual experience. It is 
implemented completely in JavaScript. The technology is 
still experimental and it is turned off in some web browsers by default. Often an upgrade of 
graphics drivers combined with adjusting your browser's settings are needed to make it work. 
WebGL should work in modern web browsers with the exception of Internet Explorer 
where it is not supported at all.

\subsection*{NCLab's WebGL Tester}

NCLab provides a "Test WebGL" button on its home page. Click on it.
If you see a window similar to the one in Fig. \ref{fig:webgl2} then you are fine. \\

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/webgl2.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-4mm}
\caption{NCLab's WebGL Tester.}
\label{fig:webgl2}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Now you can click into the WebGL tester window and move 
your mouse while keeping the left button pressed to see WebGL in action.
However, you might well see an error message similar to the one shown in Fig. \ref{fig:nowebgl}.\\


\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/nowebgl.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-4mm}
\caption{Message saying that WebGL is not enabled.}
\label{fig:nowebgl}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Troubleshooting}
\noindent
Below are some of the most usual reasons why WebGL is not working:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em You are using Internet Explorer (IE)}. IE does not have WebGL support. If you are using this web browser, please install another 
one such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc. This takes only minutes (at most) and it is highly rewarding in terms 
of improved Internet experience. In fact, poor performance of IE was causing such problems to NCLab users that 
we eventually decided to banish IE. 
\item {\em Your browser is outdated.} We recommend that you upgrade your web browser to the newest version, this 
can never hurt. 
\item {\em Your browser has WebGL disabled.} Try the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Firefox: Type {\tt about:config} in the address bar and hit enter. Ignore a message about harming your 
      warranty. In the search bar type {\tt webgl} and double-click on {\tt webgl.force-enable} and 
      {\tt webgl.prefer-native-gl} to set them to {\tt true}. Restart your browser (reloading page is not enough).
\item Chrome: Type {\tt about:flags} in the address bar and hit enter. Ignore a message saying that these 
      experiments may bite. Use CTRL + F to search for WebGL and enable it. Restart your browser. 
\end{enumerate}
\item {\em Everything fails.} In this case, try to upgrade your graphics drivers. This should help. If you still have 
problems, go to the page {\tt www.webgl.org} and try to find help there. You can also google for "graphic cards that 
support webgl" which will give you and idea whether your graphic card s supported or not. 
\item As a general observation, WebGL works almost always in Safari on more recent Mac systems  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Appendix - What is the {\em Cloud}?}

Using cloud computing or cloud computers sounds like a rocket science, but it is not,
and it really changes things for the better. Chances are that you are using 
it already, without even knowing. For example, if you are using free email services of Gmail, 
Hotmail, Yahoo or another such provider, then your data are stored on the cloud. If you are 
using free Google docs to acces your Word or Excel files from anywhere, you are using the cloud
as well. 

\subsection{Basic Facts}

In the IT sense of the word, and with a bit of simplification, the {\em cloud} 
is a pool of interconnected computers. They come in different sizes depending on the provider - 
large cloud facilities have millions of computers but some companies are running 
their own private clouds with relatively few ones. The computers in large clouds
are not very similar to your desktop PC -- they are stripped off many unnecessary 
things, compacted, and interconnected into a powerful grid. Their processors 
typically contain multiple {\em computing cores} that can share the same memory.
Such {\em multicore processors} are much more efficient compared to (clusters 
of) PCs with equivalent number of cores.

The main advantage of the cloud is its {\em elasticity}. Upon your request, the
provider will assemble for you an {\em instance} with the parameters that 
you need. An instance means a computer with given parameters (number of processors, 
hard disk size, memory). An instance is created within a minute or so, and the user can upgrade 
or downgrade it dynamically, depending on the actual needs. After the instance is 
no longer needed, it is dissolved and the same hardware is used to build instances 
for other users. The following is a realistic example of how such instances may 
look like (just the name of the provider was omitted):\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
{\bf Small instance} & 1.7 GB of memory & 1 core & 160 GB hard disk \\
\hline
{\bf Medium instance} & 7.5 GB of memory & 4 cores & 850 GB hard disk \\
\hline
{\bf Large instance} & 15 GB of memory & 8 cores & 1690 GB hard disk \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{4mm}
\noindent
Importantly - these three instances are created by grouping the same resources together 
in different ways. 
It is quite interesting to look at the prices:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
{\bf Small instance} &	\$0.085 per hour\\
\hline
{\bf Medium instance}&	\$0.34 per hour	\\
\hline
{\bf Large instance}&	\$0.68 per hour\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{4mm}
\noindent
With such low prices, literally anyone has now access to 
a powerful computer -- that otherwise would cost many thousands of dollars -- 
for just cents per hour. This brings new wonderful opportunities to ordinary users
and educators.

\subsection{Software as a Service (SaaS)}

Another big change that cloud computing brings is in how software is handled. 
Traditionally, one would buy a software in a big box with a small CD in it, 
and install it on one's computer. This model is now being challenged by a new 
approach called {\em Software as a Service (SaaS)}. The user does not have 
to own a copy of the software physically. Instead, the software is running 
on a remote server and accessed by users over the Internet. Typically, paying 
for the access is much less expensive compared to buying the software. If you like,
think about it like watching a movie on Netflix vs. buying a DVD. 

\subsection{Access from Mobile Platforms}

Last but not least, since the software is running on the cloud, the user's hardware 
does not matter so much anymore. The only really important things is to be able to 
run a web browser and access the Internet. This can be done on anything between smart 
phones, tablets, netbooks, laptops, and desktop computers. 

\subsection{Some Myths}

Very often, cloud computing is mentioned in the context of large 
computations in science, engineering, finance, and other fields. This is because there are many 
cloud providers and they need to show off. But in reality, the clouds are mostly
busy processing small tasks of ordinary users. In that case, you may say, a standard 
office PC should be enough. Not exactly. Once you are not in your office, for example
while traveling, it is difficult to reach your office PC and do things as usual. 
The cloud changes that -- it allows you to access your data 
from everywhere, any time. Once you get used to it, there is no way back. 

\subsection{NCLab and K-12 Education}

NCLab is an Online STEM Laboratory that provides 
instant access to computer simulations in physics and chemistry, 3D CAD design, 
engineering-level computer modeling, and scientific computing. You do not have 
to install any software -- NCLab is automatically available in any classroom that 
has Internet access. In contrast to traditional educational software products, 
users can access their accounts and work from anywhere and at any time.
Students can start a problem at school, finish the rest at home, and notify 
the instructor about the completion with one mouse click. Most importantly, 
however, NCLab invites K-12 teachers and students to discover new exciting 
areas that were out of their reach before.
